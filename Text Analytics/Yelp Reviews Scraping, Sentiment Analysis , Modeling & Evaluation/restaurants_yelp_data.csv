Au Festin de Babette,"Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, Desserts, Restaurants, Food","Very rustic place. Mismatched furniture, off Knick knacks. Would make a great Instagram photo place. Lots of variety on the menu. I had their brunch. Which comes with eggs, salad, potatoes, soup and dessert. Well worth the price. I was stuffed, actually couldn't finish the potatoes. Friendly service. Would definitely visit again.",4,1
Au Festin de Babette,"Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, Desserts, Restaurants, Food","I highly recommend Au Festin de Babette for their brunch. Their selection of brunches is different than most other places. The one I usually go for includes a hot drink, a soup, a gratin dauphinois, two eggs Benedict, and a chocolate mousse. All of the items are excellent, especially the gratin dauphinois. This meal is usually very satisfying and cost less than $20 which is reasonable for good brunches in Montreal. The interior is very cute and feels homie and the service is usually good.",5,1
Au Festin de Babette,"Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, Desserts, Restaurants, Food","Amazing soup and dauphinoise. BUT the wait for the table and the wait for the food were about an hour on the weekend, so be prepared! Their rose tea is good, but again all rose teas are good for me. Tip. Avoid seating near the kitchen (it can get quite pretty smokey!).",3,0

Though the food was enjoyable, the staff was despondent and absent. When coming here don't expect to be treated well. Come for the food and hot chocolate. But maybe it's best to take it to go.",2,0
Au Festin de Babette,"Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, Desserts, Restaurants, Food","I recommended this place to a friend and was excited to try it together. This was my third time visiting this establishment. Unfortunately we had a poor dining experience, especially in terms of service. We ordered a Quebecois brunch platter to share for around $17.50. This included a cup of tea/espresso. The caramelized sausages were delicous however the poached eggs were not seasoned. The pancakes were not very good either and I believe our syrup was not maple syrup, which was a disappointment. Their hot chocolate is delicious, especially The Dalmatian, but a little on the pricey side at $5 a cup (but oh so light and frothy). The service was nothing short of disappointing. If you value service, don't bother coming here. We were meandering around waiting to be assigned a table until I finally asked if we were able to sit anywhere. We then had to ask for our menus as well as place our orders. Ultimately our experience was very lackluster and I will not be returning, no matter how much I love their hot chocolate.",1,0

Les assiettes brunchs sont assez copieuses et sont composées de plusieurs éléments, variés, sucrés et salés, avec une mini mousse au chocolat! Les crêpes salées sont bonnes aussi Certains trucs étaient un peu trop gras à mon goût (le gratin, les saucisses) Le décor est super mignon Pour les groupes (8 pers et + je crois), il faut réserver et les résa le WE sont pour 11h max Dans tous les cas, je crois qu'il vaut mieux réserver car nous, le dimanche vers 11h30, c'était plein! A essayer!!",4,1

A popular spot with a cute interior, nice decor. They seemed to have large brunch meal specialities on a board, but they were written in French and our servers did not speak English. I got a mushroom cheese crepe that was great and we split a sweet king kong crepe for dessert. My boyfriend was disappointed when his egg sandwich came out with hard-boiled egg / egg salad on it. If I returned, I would be adventurous and try one of the sampler meal specials.",4,1

Nous y sommes allés un jour de beau temps et chaleur. Comme c'était quand même pas mal bruyant à l'intérieur nous avons choisi la terrasse... ils ont les pieds de parasol mais pas les parasols... pas tant agréable vu la chaleur!! Côté repas, le gratin dauphinois par 30deg n'est pas tant rafraîchissant (pas le choix avec les ufs bénédictines) et en plus il était cramé sur le dessus.

Cela dit le restaurant est mignon et les propriétaires précisent sur leur présentation que l endroit est modeste et qu on ne vient pas chez Babette pour sa décoration. Les brunch sont copieux mais l on regrettera que la bruscheta annoncée soit en fait un croûton microscopique avec deux petits carrés de tomates. Les plats sont goûteux et le choix est varié vous trouverez forcément votre bonheur sur leur carte Le thé ou le café est offert dans le menu brunch ce qui est appréciable - surtout quand on constate que le jus de fruit est à 4.50$..

Que vous ayez envie de sucré (Panna cotta aux fruits rouges, verrine du moment qui accompagne quasiment chaque plat, etc.) ou de salé (y compris du gratin dauphinois!), vous trouverez sûrement de quoi vous satisfaire. Plusieurs plats sont également disponibles pour les végétariens et il y a une grande sélection de thés. La terrasse est relativement classique mais, par contre, l'intérieur a un charme authentique et ""vintage"" indéniable. Jetez un coup d'il aux photos et vous comprendrez. Il y a également assez de place pour accueillir des grands groupes. Seul petit bémol: le restaurant ouvre à 10h la fin de semaine, ce qui est légèrement tard pour un brunch. Je recommande!",5,1

We ordered a hot chocolate, a crepe with ham, cheese, and mushrooms, and a crepe with caramel. The hot chocolate was a real hot chocolate, served in a bowl with a spoon. The ham, cheese and mushroom crepe wasn't that great. I took a few bites but that's it. The caramel crepe was good. Although all te caramel seemed to be in the middle and not around the edges.

I have found my favorite tea spot (Alice's Tea Cup, NYC), french toast spot (Mother's Bistro, Portland), and gyros spot (Halal Guys gyros plate, NYC). Today, I have found my favorite hot chocolate spot tucked away in the Latin Quarter of Montreal. I went with the classic Babette hot chocolate from the menu and came close to fainting after the first sip. In fact, I was so overwhelmed by all the happiness going on in my taste bud world, I danced to the counter and in chocolate drunkeness asked the owner to marry me. Ok, no I didn't. But I did say, WHAT IS IN THIS I WANT IT NOW. So I purchased the chocolate chips and spices (special ingredients) to take home with me. Their hot chocolate is stellar.

The reproductions of 20s era adverts for sale were really tempting. I tried Le Babette. On my first sip I said ""Oh WOW!"" Drinking chocolates are something I love, and this one was the best I ever had. It definitely made my chilly walk down St.Denis a lot better. Smooth and sweet without being overly so. It wasn't as spicy as I had expected. I am looking forward to trying more of their 21 flavours. Looking forward to stopping here once it warms up and enjoying their terrace.",5,1

This was definitely a find on Rue St. Denis. There are tons of little cafés, shops & restaurants on this being the most popular street of Montreal. Finding this little gem was a great way to end our stay. This cute and oh so comfy café was the perfect place to enjoy the city and by far, serves the best gelato that I've EVER had! (outside of Italy, of course) The gelato was light, creamy and full of flavor. I enjoyed the gelato so much that I could not leave without having seconds! (it was seriously that good) I know, I know, there are tons of similar establishments in Montreal, but I really do believe that you won't be disappointed at Au festin de Babette. Take a seat, enjoy the café, while sipping a cappuccino, after gorging on one of their delectable pastries or gelatos...you'll almost forget you are in Canada, but rather in some café in Europe.",4,1
BV Pub and Pizzeria,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Italian, Pizza",1st experience was with one of my daughters about 6 months ago. Couldn't remember the name of the place and barely remembered where as we had just relocated from across the country. Brought all three girls today and they graciously seated us even though the entire place was reserved for a trivia night about 40 minutes later. Great service. White Sauce Calzone was perfect! Girls got Margherita Calzone and Bianca Pizza. They loved it! The Penne & Meatballs was take-out for hubby... he loved it too! Looks like we have found a good go-to Italian! The classic rock playing was an added bonus.,5,1
BV Pub and Pizzeria,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Italian, Pizza",This is a great surprise. Unassuming from the front of the building. Had the shrimp scampi and it was great. Super fast service and everyone was super nice and attentive ! We defaulted here because of a wait at another restaurant nearby. So glad we did. We'll be back. Nice job !,5,1
BV Pub and Pizzeria,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Italian, Pizza","Great neighborhood spot for Italian. They support good causes like the Isabella Santos Foundation, so I want to support businesses like this. I came for a spaghetti dinner for ISF, which included salad and spaghetti. So yummy and friendly service. Several beer and wine options, delicious homemade potato chips with garlic and Parmesan, so what more do you want? Will be back to try more of the menu!",4,1
BV Pub and Pizzeria,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Italian, Pizza",Huge fan of their meatball subs! Homemade meatballs plus just the right amount of crunch of the bread (I'm all about the texture).

BV Pub and Pizzeria,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Italian, Pizza","Oh my gosh! Let's update BV's review! Turns out, the bar WAS full of regulars and they are now my friends. No seriously, they'll tell you they're my friends. I DID see them the day after I wrote my initial review, and the day after that, and the day after that, and the day after that.... And I love them. The food is delicious. They switch to a ""late night"" menu after around 9pm, when the grills get turned off, but even everything on there is delicious. I've had everything from the pizza to the Grown up Mac & Cheese, and its fantastic. The beers are local and domestic. You could pick a beer off the tap lineup, or grab a PBR or High Life. Keeping it classy. Football is big, if there's a game on (especially panthers) then a seat may be hard to find. Come early. The bartenders are fantastic and friendly, remember your name and your drink. One of my favorite things about this bar is the regulars, and not just because I am one. Every time I come in here they have some charity event coming up - whether its collecting blankets for the local dog shelter, or raising money for Isabella Santos Foundation (shameless plug), BV is helping, connecting people and bringing the community together. I love it. This year alone, they've raised over $2000 for the Isabella Santos Foundation, and over $7000 at their local charity golf tournament for Making Strides. I love this bar. See you all tomorrow, its ladies night - its gonna be big. Go Jets.",5,1

Ordered "" the works"" w pretty good! however...The place had about 6 people total in it all impressed me as local bar flies. There was one fat sloppy looking woman who kept yelling her head off. I don't know if she was drunk deaf or both!!!The music they were playing there made rap sound pretty good....I hate rap with a passion!!!

BV Pub and Pizzeria,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Italian, Pizza","We went on a Sunday, there was one woman working and we waited a LONG time.... The food was just ""OK"" - maybe it was an off night, but I truly hoped for more flavorful sauce and certainly better service for a Sunday evening pizza/beer night. I give the one woman working the bar and tables credit - she maintained composure and did what she could, but it was a LOT to manage as nearly every table was taken as well as the bar. A bunch of what seemed to be regulars were in and out for smoke breaks which made the place smell like cigarettes pretty consistently. (It's a small place so this was not really shocking). We may be back, but it'll be awhile before we venture in - figure we'll give them time to get it together.",2,0

It's a small place with about 12 tables and a bar that seats about 10. They do have a good draft beer selection considering how small the place is. Looks like they have some good happy hour food specials 4-7 M-F as well. Went solo so not able to try a lot but what I did get was very good. Ordered a calzone with meatballs, sausage, spinach and roasted red peppers. Thought it was very good. Marinara was good and it was a good size portion, this is a place I would good back to.",4,1

BV Pub and Pizzeria,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Italian, Pizza","Excellent place to chill and check out sports over lunch. Their pizza is pretty remarkable, similar to New York Style, large foldable slices. The burgers are very good with different themed ones as well. The BV signature burger has pesto, grilled red peppers and mozzarella, which is pretty top notch. Also a good bar for drinks after work, and a very popular spot for Trivia on Thursday nights. Try their Big Meaty pizza, their calzones, and the Chicken Parm sub. You can't go wrong with either of these. Only thing bad about the place is when they are packed it can be a bit noisy. This is one place that's more of a ""friend's hangout"" than romantic atmosphere, but that's okay.",5,1

The restaurant is cozy and well staffed, and on a Friday night the crowd was about average - no wait. We ordered the mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and they were good, but nothing out of the ordinary, exactly what you'd expect. We each got a Calzone and that's when we were blown away. The bread/crust was fluffy yet crispy and cooked perfectly. The waitress even told us to take a picture before we started eating because it was so perfect. I had mushrooms, black olives and green peppers in mine and my husband had pepperoni and meatballs in his. We both LOVED them and will certainly go back for them again!

I try to eat healthy (most times) so I had a gluten free spicy chicken wrap. What I really wanted was the Belly Buster sandwich. A monster of a sandwich. It is 8 inches of garlic bread with meatballs,sausage,pepperoni, cheese, banana peppers and mozzarella sticks. They also have a challenge for their 16 inch version. No one has accomplished this feat as of yet. The wife had the chicken cordon bleu wrap with fresh garlic Parmesan potato chips. I can see why my wife's family keeps coming back.

BV Pub and Pizzeria,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Italian, Pizza","I won't be back. It was just so unremarkable on every level that I can't see myself becoming even a fan. First off, we showed up at dinnertime and there were maybe 3 tables with people sitting at them. A family, some friends raucously laughing in the bar area, and some other crew. We had heard this place was worth trying, and it's quite close to where we live, so we thought, ""why not?"" We are kind of pretzel snobs, so we immediately asked if the pretzel appetizer consisted of house-made pretzels. Negative. One star removed just for that. With so many establishments in the area hoofing it to make their own pretzels, and this place already has some baking happening (pizza), I expected better. We skipped apps and ended up splitting a mediocre salad. I ordered a veggie calzone, expecting something delicious. When it FINALLY arrived, it was enormous and beautiful. I mean, huge! I believe there's a picture of this monster on the restaurant listing. Digging in, i found two types of cheese. Mozz and goat cheese (?). Texture-wise, it was strange because of the mozzarella's super melty-ness and the other cheese's not-quite-as-much-ness. The vegetables inside, once I found them, were boring. No italian seasonings, no char, nothing remarkable. And the marinara served as a dipping sauce didn't deliver either. I couldn't have eaten the whole thing if I'd tried, not that it would have been worth the effort. I read up and saw that other reviewers had better experiences. I believe the Mr. had some good wings, and I imagine that carnivores would appreciate a calzone with some spicy meats inside. For me, this place just didn't make the list of return spots.",2,0
BV Pub and Pizzeria,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Italian, Pizza",I stopped in one day with a few friends shortly after they opened and is now my local favorite. Food is very good. Pepperoni rolls are one of my favorites. Chicken wings are meaty. Pizza is excellent! We find it a hidden Italian secret in Ballantyne. It's nice to walk in and be welcomed with a warm hello and immeditae service. Happy hour prices cant be beat and they even provide Koozies to keep your beer cold . Great environment for friends and the whole family. On point all around!!,5,1
BV Pub and Pizzeria,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Italian, Pizza","Thursday night is 50cent wing night, which I especially enjoyed because (a) there is also Team Trivia (b) they mixed Hot and Lemon Pepper flavors for me, which oddly many places don't (c) they let me order 10 instead of forcing me to order in multiples of 6 (d) they gave me all flappers (e) my tea refills were frequent (which helped since their Hot is actually Hot) 5 reasons, 5 stars, done. I'd happily go back.",5,1
BV Pub and Pizzeria,"Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Italian, Pizza","This bar & pizza restaurant is on the smaller side of things. During lunch it can take a little bit longer to receive your food, however, both the pizzas and calzones are worth waiting for. Not only are they fresh and cooked to order (unlike some of the places that offer pizza by the slice), but they are also priced fairly. They also offer a daily special for those looking for additional savings. The service is reasonably quick and always friendly. I have not been during the evening, but for lunch I would recommend Buona Vita without hesitation.",4,1

Pizza was tasty, but crust was soft, not quite soggy. More like a pie crust, not a pizza crust.",2,0
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","I'm not pizza person but my son asked me to come here for pizza after Tae Kwon Do, he loved it! The young man who was taking the order was very nice and friendly and the pizza came freshly in few minutes, was all good.",4,1

Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","After waiting 2 hours for a Dominos pizza that was never delivered and being hung up on by the Dominos manager, my wife and I still really wanted pizza. It was 9:55 pm and Barros closed at 10 pm but I gave them a call anyways not expecting to be able to order. I was pleasantly surprised that they took my order and told me it would be ready in 10 minutes so I headed over to pick it up. When I got there I was greeted by Nick who was in the back and came right up, apologizing that he was in the back helping train some new employees. He reviewed my order and realized it was slightly incorrect and immediately headed back and fixed my pizza that had just been put in the oven. After only 2-3 mins he came back up, apologized and then proceeded to give me a discount for having to wait on him...I was so happy that I was even able to order 5 minutes before closing I would have taken any pizza no problem, but Nick made the whole experience exceptional. After having such a poor experience with another pizza chain it was such a relief to come in here and be treated with such respect and service that was above and beyond. I would highly recommend this place! Excellent job Nick and keep up the amazing work!",5,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza",I love Barros. This place makes great pizza like the rest. The restaurant always seems quiet and it looks like a great place for a party.,5,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza",Barros has always been one of my favorite pizza's. Don't call this location for delivery. The girl who took my order stated delivery would be 45 minutes. More like 1 1/2 hours. When I called back to see why it was taking so long she changed the delivery time and said the deliveries were going to take longer. If she had told me an accurate time when I called in the order I would have placed my order with a different location.I will call the Indian Bend location next time.,2,0
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza",Best pizza and wings in town! Their ranch is really good. Crust is fluffy and chewy. They deliver. It is Pricey for pizza and wings though. Wish they had canolis for dessert!,5,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","This is your typical (in every good way) local greasy pizza joint but the wings are amazing!!!! We get Barros like, more than we should admit and live dangerously close but it's soooooo good. They also do pizza by the slice lunch specials that can't be beat. I love this place. Wings come in boneless or regular and tons of different sauces.",4,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","Love this place! The staff here is so super sweet, it is always a quick in and out experience. Delicious pizza and mozzarella sticks.",5,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","Here's the thing, I like Barro's Pizza. The one in Cave Creek was awesome. We use this one to order for our employees, so I order from this place alot, and this has to be the worst Barro's there is. I literally have to spell the order out for them every time. ""Make sure the pizza is cooked throughout."" Because I have gotten undercooked pizza at least 3 times from this place. Then there was the day they were ""short staffed"". It took nearly 30 minutes to place the order. Then when they said it would take 1hour, it took 2hrs. Today was the final straw. Hot Wing Pizza from every other Barros includes Ranch, these guys seem to always forget that EACH time. So today, I asked to make sure they don't forget it. ""Um Sir, that's extra.""What! Wow. So they literally had to get ""manager's approval"" to give me a ranch for a hot wing pizza, where it should be included.",1,0
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","Love this place. I know it's a chain but this location rocks! I come at least once a week. I got my usual, the half meatball sub with chips for only $3.50! Be sure to check out the salad bar. The service is friendly and food is ready to pick up when promised.",5,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza",I've always had great service here. And if something is wrong they correct it right away. I have read threw a lot of review of bad experiences and I am sorry for that. When it was new they were trying to gain there feet. Now it's better then before. But one review said something about there Caesar salad not being great. They DON'T have Caesar salad. But I have posted several photos of my food and it's nothing less then amazing. Great job guys. Keep it up,5,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","Our family loves Barros! Their pizza is by far our favorite. A couple of weeks ago we ordered a pizza, for delivery, after over 75 minutes and no pizza we contacted them. A young girl answered the phone and said the driver had gotten lost, she apologized but essentially said ""nothing I can do."" Our pizza finally arrived, it was so cold :( My husband was so upset, he called back and asked to speak with the manager. Again he apologized but also followed with ""what do you want me to do."" His demeanor lacked consideration for our position. We did finally have another pizza delivered to replace the cold one. We gave them another shot just yesterday. Ordered a pizza, sadly again when it arrived it was ridiculously cold. This time though we didn't even bother to call. Lesson learned, simply not ordering from there again. Sad face.",2,0
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza",I have been coming to this barros for a few weeks now. They have a very affordable lunch special with a different pizza of the day. I have had nothing but a good experience when I dine in or take out. I would highly recommend barros to anyone looking for an affordable lunch.,5,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","Good stuff, Man! We always get The Barros Special, which is a really great pie. Antipasta salad is always fresh and good, and the sides (cheese bread, mozzarella sticks, etc.) are always pretty delish. Delivery is consistent and punctual.",4,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza",Came in at 3:30 for the lunch special that ends at 4. I asked for multiple slices of pepperoni and was told they weren't going to make any more (no other Barros would do that so early). Multiple customers came in afterwards looking for cheese which they were also out of and they offered to make them. The pizza I was given had clearly been sitting for a while and it seemed like they were trying to get rid of those slices. Rather odd service for a chain of restaurants that does so well with lunch slices.,2,0
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","This is a GOOD neighborhood pizza joint. When I'm in a ""Pizza Hut"" (but better) mood this is where I come for a hearty pizza, nothing fancy like Oregano's or Grimaldi's, but amongst the best local ""regular"" pizza in town. I really like their traditional/regular crust. I think it has a unique flavor. I also enjoy their thin crust, which still gives you the satisfaction of eating a real pizza...Not so thin you feel you're eating an overgrown potato chip with cheese and sauce on top. Our favorite is the Barro's Special. Replace the green peppers with the jalapeños if you like heat. The place is also very kid friendly. Their cheese pizza is a staple at toddler birthday parties. Their decor is very informal, but comfortable. Not so fancy you feel guilty when your kids spill. The staff is mostly part time high schoolers wearing the Barro's uniform. They are friendly and mean well, though they make the occasional high schoolish mistake, which management is quick to fix. Pricing is very reasonable and they have great specials such as 2 larges, 1topping each for $19.99. We've picked up or dined in more times than I can count and we will continue to do so.",4,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","We are always looking for less expensive places in Scottsdale to eat with our kids and Barros delivered! (Not literally... We ate in the restaurant :)) We had lunch specials; Kids eating pizza and us having the salad bar. The kids loved the pizza and other than the lettuce being a bit brown (hence the lack of 5 stars) the salad bar was small, but had everything we were looking for. Not to mention it was very clean and nicely decorated. Great portions and a great price!",4,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","I was visiting some family in Scottsdale and we stopped in here for lunch...gotta say - solid pizza! Got the thin crust with salami and mushrooms. Great price and the crust was nice and crunchy fresh out of the oven. Good tasting sauce and the sauce to cheese ratio was spot on for me. Beer selection is a little lacking if you're into craft beer, but hopefully they'll bring in some local stuff on tap. Definitely worth checking out!",4,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","My family is a fan of Barro's so we were happy to hear that this location delivered to our houses. Got the pizza last night. Delivery took around an hour. The pizza came hot. It was in good shape, not too greasy, well cooked. Yum!",4,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","Ordered 5 pizzas and an order of 24 wings for delivery for a party. We were told it would be 40-45 minutes. Well...an hour and fifteen minutes later my wife called and was told that they had gotten busy unexpectedly and that they were working on it. On the second call they assured us that it was on its way. About an hour and forty minutes after we ordered lukewarm pizzas and ice cold wings finally arrived - yes, not just room temperature wings that had been sitting too long but wings that were so cold that they had to still be refrigerated. The wings were fully cooked, just ice cold. So, do they serve frozen fully cooked wings instead of making them fresh? That would certainly appear to be the case based on what was delivered to us. When my wife called a third time to tell them that the wings were still ice cold they offered a store credit for the price if the wings. Like we are going to go back there again after this experience. If I want frozen wings I can buy them from the freezer section and cook them myself. This was probably the most incompetent pizza order I have experienced. To be fair, my wife and son had eaten there in-store once previously and their experience wasn't as lousy as this one. But to have a house full of people waiting for dinner to arrive tonight - and then for the pizza to be lukewarm and the wings to be ice cold - wasn't fun.",1,0
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza",I have been a regular customer at Barro's for almost 25 years and I am sorry to say the new Scottsdale location on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. gets a one star from us. On our 2nd. visit ( Our mistake) we again were very disappointed to say the least. We ordered a thin crust pizza and a dozen wings. The crust on the pizza was soggy at best and the celery that came with the wings looked like a truck had run it over which was also how it was on our first visit. How can you screw up celery? We will revert back to the Pavillions location where there never seems to be a problem. I doubt the F.L.R. location will be around long as again like our first visit we were the only two in the place at 6:30 PM. I guess that should have been a warning to us.,1,0
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","I want to give this location three stars, but I'm trying to be nice in hopes they improve upon being the Barros I know and love. I've loved Barros since they put a location in at the Pavilions in Scottsdale. That location has always been amazing and very well priced. Now that they put one in my neck of the woods, I was very excited to try this new location and also introduce my boyfriend to Barros. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The only thing we ordered was a 12"" pizza. yup, a small one for us to split. Pizza's don't take that long to cook to begin with. Finally after 30 minutes of waiting (yes, I timed it), I go up to talk to someone and the girl sweeping helps me out. mind you, it's not busy at all. There's maybe five tables occupied if you count ours, too. She goes to check on it and brings out the pizza. Tells us that they're sorry, they messed up on the first pizza (which could be avoided by following orders) so they had to make another one. Good customer service would mean coming to tell us 15 minutes prior that they made a mistake and it's going to be a little bit for them to remake a pizza. We would have been totally fine if someone would have said something. Here we are thinking they just forgot about us. The pizza itself was completely unlike the one at the other Scottsdale location. When I think of Barros, I think of crust and how they have the best crust. Very bummed that it wasn't it's usual fluffy cust, but flat and barely anything there. Funny thing, as we finished our pizza, the people that had been sitting next to us for quite a while had an employee ask them if they got their pizza yet and they said, ""no"". The pros of this visit are that they have oregano you can use yourself, self-serve fountain drinks and They did let us keep the pizza they messed up on. At least my boyfriend said he enjoyed it!",4,1
Barros Pizza,"Italian, Sandwiches, Restaurants, Pizza","Finally! A decent pizza place in the neighborhood that has indoor seating! After being disappointed by the area pizza joints, I had given up on hoping I could find a place to go without driving 20 minutes for eat-in pizza. Of course, Rustic pizza is in the same shopping center, but good luck finding a spot to sit down. Barro's Pizza has a roomy interior, with plenty of seating. Parmesean and hot flakes are at each table, and a meager but tasty salad bar up front to help you stave off your hunger until the pie is finished. I went in and ordered a personal small pepperoni pizza, salad, and drink. I was given a salad bowl and helped myself to the salad bar, a drink, and then sat down and ate until my pizza was delivered tableside. The pizza was hot. Really hot. Right out of the oven hot. That made me feel really good -- I hate cold, warm, or reheated-tasting pizza. This was FRESH. The pepperoni was really spicy, and crisped on the edges the way pepperoni is supposed to be! The crust was dry, with a nice coating of corn meal on the outside, nearly perfect (If I had to really nitpick, the crust was slightly too bready). The moz cheese was good quality and it was everything I was missing from our local pizza places. I would like to see a better salad bar, with more options. It's pretty sparse and there's a lot of room for improvement. They also have subs and pasta, which I intend to try in the (very near) future",4,1
Beer Garden,"Pubs, Pizza, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Restaurants, Nightlife, Food, Bars, Specialty Food",Wow we stopped here one late afternoon and we had this beautiful beer garden all to ourselves! I feel like many people have not yet discovered this little gem. I like how they have a full bar menu and do not simply serve beer as the name implies. But heck almost every drinking establishment in Las Vegas has a full bar menu. I loved the people watching. Loved the ambience. Love the variety of music playing at a loud but not shouting loud volume. And most of all I LOVED MY DRINK!! Great Old Fashioned. Great place!,5,1
Beer Garden,"Pubs, Pizza, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Restaurants, Nightlife, Food, Bars, Specialty Food",I highly recommend this place the atmosphere is just to die for it's close to Fremont Street which is such a plus and I highly recommend ordering their pizza wings and any appetizers because it is just absolutely awesome. I will for sure be returning to this place every time I visit Vegas,5,1
Beer Garden,"Pubs, Pizza, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Restaurants, Nightlife, Food, Bars, Specialty Food",Good selection of beers. Never noticed it there and I go there twice a year.

Beer Garden,"Pubs, Pizza, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Restaurants, Nightlife, Food, Bars, Specialty Food","It's a nice little unpretentious drop by spot, you can either take a seat and people watch, or grab a quick brew to go. Sadly, kids aren't allowed inside, not even on the patio, they would have actually really liked the food selection. That's the only thing that kept us from eating here, so we had to grab dinner elsewhere to accommodate the family. However, I did take a Pranqster from North Coast Brewing Co. to go, never heard of it before, turned out to be a delicious wheat. Will now look for it, it was fresh, smooth, very tasty. The girl working the counter was very sweet and super friendly, the patrons seemed to be having a great time. Definitely a return to place in the future, hope to try the food and experience the patio next time.",4,1
Beer Garden,"Pubs, Pizza, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Restaurants, Nightlife, Food, Bars, Specialty Food",I like the concept of the place but it just failed to deliver. First let me say there is a nice young lady there some days who is pretty good. I have been at the plaza 2 weeks and this bars always dead. There isn't any good music of a feel. The bar area with the liquor is stale and seems empty. I tried the food but it was so salty and over cooked. I enjoy the beers but I was always the only guy at the place. Today I want to have a good beer and a young guy was bartending. He was leaned over the bar texting and didn't notice me. I LEFT! Sorry to bother you with my money. If I left the owners can bet others do to! I don't allow cell phones at my store and not sure why they do. Stand at the bad smile and make eye contact with the hundreds of people who walk by them. Invite people in. Make some money! Absent management sure to lead to a failure.,2,0
Beer Garden,"Pubs, Pizza, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Restaurants, Nightlife, Food, Bars, Specialty Food",Cold hotdogs. I mean they are supposed to be hot. The fries are standard frozen French fries even though the menu says hand cut. The onion strings are pretty good with ranch. Only 2 stars because of the cold hotdog and the lie of hand cut fries.,2,0
Beer Garden,"Pubs, Pizza, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Restaurants, Nightlife, Food, Bars, Specialty Food",Most of the beers on the menu that are supposed to be Belgian really aren't. There is no Blue Moon in Belgium or Northcoast brewery. And there are several more mistakes. They should get their act together and don't lie about the origins of their beers. There is no substitute for the real thing.,2,0

I seriously recommend the German Brat loaded with sauerkraut and Cajun Bleu cheese crumbles on a pretzel bun! Nice selection of draft craft beer and a full bar if you aren't a beer nerd. Indoor space is limited, but a really nice outdoor area. The band, if playing, can be a bit loud though. Friendly staff and extremely reasonable prices.",5,1
Beer Garden,"Pubs, Pizza, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Restaurants, Nightlife, Food, Bars, Specialty Food","Looking for a place with real grass in Las Vegas? Well this is it! Located just outside the food court of Plaza Hotel, this patch of grass is equipped with picnic tables, live music and great seats for people watching. The selection of beer includes the all time favorites but also some interesting must-trys like the Coconut Curry or Banana Bread beer! While you are there, don't forget to order a pretzel. Comes with two different (delicious) dipping sauces and the pretzel is bigger than the plate. Definitely a great place to hang out and relax with good company.",5,1
Biaggio's Pizzeria,"Italian, Restaurants, Food, Pizza, Specialty Food, Pasta Shops","First order on Yelp! delivery! The menu is nice and extensive. You can order wings individually. Lots of nice pizza options. We ordered a cheese pizza, light sauce, side salad, chicken wings, and a Stromboli. The pizza was hot, cheesy, and the taste was good! The wings were cooked perfectly and I appreciate that we didn't get a ton of drumettes. The Stromboli was literally the size of my husbands forearm! It was way too much food for our family and we had leftovers for 3 days. My only disappointment was the salad, but it wasn't a huge deal. It had no flavor and the house Italian dressing had no flavor, so it was like eating an oily, watery moosh. Overall we would definitely give them another try.",4,1

Upon understanding I had a long drive after pick up, the person at the counter offered me a free soft drink. Wow, if that's not a friendly awesome service, I don't know what is. Large pizza with half mushrooms & sausages and half with ham & pineapples. To my surprise, my picky other half loved it, as did I. For those of you living close by this place, I envy you. I'd DEFINITELY would make the long trip to eat/carry out again!",5,1

We ordered a chicken Philly cheese steak, got a beef Philly cheese steak. Paid extra $4 for black and green olives in calzone, could find neither. Fries were oily and mushy. Most of what we did get was good but one person had nothing to eat and the food is overpriced considering that you don't get what you order. Won't order from here again. Dinner for two with soda and cheesecake was $67 plus tip. Disappointing! Manager wrote to apologize and offered to replace sandwich. We'll give them another chance! Appreciate the kind response.",4,1

I love that they leave the garlic sauce sauce at the bottom so you can dip it in there too or in the marinara sauce! We got our pizza and let me just say this is how pizza should be! They are definitely generous with their toppings, the sausage is delicious as well as everything else. Definitely a place to come back to!

Biaggio's Pizzeria,"Italian, Restaurants, Food, Pizza, Specialty Food, Pasta Shops","EXCELLENT FOOD! We ordered online for dinner for 6. Italian Sub, GF Chicken Parm (with no cheese), 12"" cheese pizza and a side salad. There were no descriptions on the online order form so I went with what I know; and how I make Gf items. I figured the gluten free chicken parm would be breaded in gluten free bread crumbs. I asked for no cheese. I also thought a gf spaghetti or other pasta would be served. I was surprised to open and find that this was a grilled chicken breast, still covered in cheese, and served with cheese ravioli. Disappointed and concerned that my 3 year old would be unable to eat. My friend called and Biaggo said he would make us new food. I was really impressed with the level of service we received. They replaced the parm with a gf pizza, free of charge, offered to deliver (we declined but appreciated the offer), and they gave my husband 2 slices of cheese cake to go. Every single thing we ate was delicious. I honestly cannot say when the last time I ate gluten free pizza that didn't taste like cardboard was. This was amazing. The sauce is delicious. The Italian dressing on the side salad was better than anything we've ever had. Every bite was eaten without a crumb left. You've gained customers for life. We are amazed by your service and love your food. Thank you!",5,1

Cheesy, crispy, melty goodness. We had a meatball, pepperoni and mushroom and it was to-die-for delicious. The caesar salad is simple and tasty, and our order of zucchini chips were made in-house. They have a lot of gluten-free options, and THEY WILL DELIVER TO MOUNTAIN'S EDGE for a pittance of a delivery fee ($4). To top it all off, the owner greeted us and thanked us for visiting, and he sat and chatted with us while we enjoyed his amazing food. Our server was a doll, also. I am sooooo on this train!",5,1

This was delivered to the office over the weekend, along with Caesar salad and garlic knots and the staff couldn't get enough. You know a restaurant is good when you want to rave about every item you had not just one thing in particular. Surprisingly, living in the area I've never even heard of the place but now I'm addicted, I'll be back with my husband this week. (So much for losing that post-baby weight, it's worth it!)",5,1

The pizza bianca was fantastic, as was the standard one to which we added pepperoni and sausage. Having read on Yelp that Biaggio makes his own sausage, we just had to add that delicious, sumptuous topping. Biaggio's crust is just right: crispy and amber-brown on the bottom, but not hard--it is pliant enough for anyone, even the dentally-challenged, to eat. We requested ""no garlic"" on both pizzas, and our wish was graciously fulfilled. Biaggio's Pizzeria at Fort Apache is a reliable, classic place for pizza.",5,1
Biaggio's Pizzeria,"Italian, Restaurants, Food, Pizza, Specialty Food, Pasta Shops","This is my very first interview on YELP.. so I am not sure it will stay on the page.. or go to a filter. Biaggio's Pizzeria on Flamingo/Fort Apache was right next to a salon that I worked in, and this pizzeria is fantastic. I think it's a ""little known secret"" that no one knows about yet. Even though the owner (Biaggio) has an extensive menu, I always opted to order one of my favorites: ""the Art of Chicken"". Which is a homemade pizza topped with chicken (of course) (and lots of it), fresh artichokes, amazing roasted tomatoes (that I think makes the pizza so mouth watering), garlic and black olives. My habit of ordering was to get a slice of the Art of Chicken (which is crispy on the bottom; not too think and definitely not thin) and loaded with all of the ingredients above. (With a side of Marinara sauce). Biaggio's chefs are very ample on the portions... and I used to always order that traditional orange soda in a bottle called .. hmmm.. I cannot quite remember. Oh yes, when I first met Biaggio he told me that his wings were the ""best"". At the time, I did not believe him. I thought he was using a ""sales pitch"" on me. So I declined buying any. Well.. because I worked right next to his building, a few feet in my beauty salon next to his restaurant.. he sent over one of his chefs (a few minutes later).. with a full order of deep fried wings... complimentary just for me to try. YOU HAVE TO EAT THEM HOT and right when they are made. He was right!!! These were the best wings I have ever tasted. The skin and the batter was super crunchy and had an amazing taste. The chicken wings and legs themselves.. melted in my mouth.. literally. Not sure if I had chicken that ever did just that. But I only order them when I know I don't have to share. Biaggio simply is the BEST out there.. just like you are in NYC. (Love you Biaggio) (from your favorite flower Rose).",5,1
Biaggio's Pizzeria,"Italian, Restaurants, Food, Pizza, Specialty Food, Pasta Shops","This place is incredible! I walked in to order a large pepperoni pizza with sausage and they told me it will be about 20 minutes(which is relatively quick for the quality of the zzas) As I waited I noticed they had wifi but I neglected to ask for the password. I forgot to mention that the employees were so friendly and kind to everyone in the restaurant. The pizza came on time and I took the pizza home and the pizza was delicious! The sausage had a lot of spices and tasted very exquisite, the crust was toasty and soft at the same time. Overall delicious and amazing employees will buy again.",4,1

Biaggio's Pizzeria,"Italian, Restaurants, Food, Pizza, Specialty Food, Pasta Shops","I went to Biaggio's because of all the positive yelp reviews on here. . . they did not disdapoint. They serve real pizza here. We ordered the white pizza, it was awesome. The mozz was fresh and the ricotta was smooth and creamy. No one ingredient on the pizza was overpowering, a rarity in my opinion. The crust of thr pizza was perfect. PERFECT. It was thin, crispy but not burnt, and completely cooked. The crust was what really made the pizza and what will keep mr coming back. The only reason I didnt rate it five stars was because the pizza had too much oil on it for me. Also, I wasnt the biggest fan of the decor, i dont think that the oversized pictures of food fit this place very well. Biaggios is pizza without equal in west las vegas, give it a shot you wont be dissapointed.",4,1
Biaggio's Pizzeria,"Italian, Restaurants, Food, Pizza, Specialty Food, Pasta Shops",We drove from Aliante to here because of reviews. I had been asking my bf for 3 weeks to make the drive Bcz of the reviews. Since Ciao Ciao closed we are ruined - only secret pizza in the cosmopolitan has helped w our craving. Pros: young lady @ register was super nice Ranch dressing was good Cons: beeping noise on register Crust has NO taste/texture Food needs garlic Salad lettuce was not fresh Display of cold pizza in glass has u ask is this going to be cooked or do we order fresh No menu board behind register-u hv to read a menu@ register. We waited awhile so ordered a salad Bcz we were starving & then they gave free apps to the booth behind us for waiting wtf! Bottom line: pricy-& I don't get the other rave reviews- there's 3-4 reviews like mine that are spot on.waste of $$$ & gas,2,0
Biaggio's Pizzeria,"Italian, Restaurants, Food, Pizza, Specialty Food, Pasta Shops","Just Awesome! Went in here for the first time a couple of months ago. Had the meatball sub. I love the meatballs!! Very tasty. While there the owner came by and asked if it was my first time here and I said yes, and then he gave me slice of pizza to try! It was really good! It is on the greasy side but that's what makes it taste so good. I mean it wasn't overly or anything, just more taste than other pizza. I don't know I loved it. I also order out from time to time from this place. The online ordering system is quite easy to use. I don't beleive they give you a time of when they will deliver like some places but about 45 minutes sounds about right. If they have any questions for you they will call you and ask. I know one time I placed an order for meatball parm and I got the meatball sub and called it in and they made a return trip to give me the meatball parm :) that was very nice, I was more concerned that I received the wrong order! Very nice...very good on service too. I've had no problems with them that they didn't take care of me. Also the prices are not bad, very affordable. I love eatting their parm, it's like spagetti and meatball but with baked cheese on top that's nice and gooy yum! Always fresh and hot when it gets delivered...If I feel like staying home and getting some pasta this is my go to place. :)",5,1
Biaggio's Pizzeria,"Italian, Restaurants, Food, Pizza, Specialty Food, Pasta Shops","This is by far the best Pizzeria I've ever been to. As soon as I walked in, Mr. Biaggio welcomed me with a big smile. He treated me like a regular even though it was my first time in there. I'd give it 5 stars just for the excellent customer service (seriously, I don't think you can find any better customer service than at this place)! I arrived a bit early (for pickup) and before I could even sit down, Mr. Biaggio came over and gave me a bottle of water. Even before I left with the pizza, Mr. Biaggio came running over and said, ""Let me check to see if it's perfect."" Can you name another pizza place that does that? Now on to the food. It's seriously the closest thing to New York style pizza you can find here in Vegas. The crust is perfect..not too thin..not too thick. I ordered the pepperoni pizza, and boy, do they pile the pepperoni on! I also had the buffalo wings and just like Mr. Biaggio said himself, ""They are to die for!"". They were perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of crunch to them. And the buffalo sauce was delicious! I also tried the garlic knots and yum...they had a bit of a crunch to them but were soft enough to melt in your mouth. My brother, who is a very picky eater, said that if he could rate it from 1-10, he would rate it a 12. I'll definitely be back! And I'll be sure to tell everyone I know about this wonderful place (in fact, I already started that, hahah). Mr. Biaggio, if you're reading this, thank you for everything tonight! Thank you for making me feel welcomed and treating me like an old friend. I can tell that you really truly care about the quality of your food and the customers. I can assure you this won't be the last time you see me! :D",5,1

It's a small location and there was no hostess so you just say yourself which is fine. Our server was nice and did a good job.

Probably won't be back.",2,0
Blackfinn Ameripub,"Restaurants, American (New)","Wife and I stopped in to have a drink and an appetizer. Unfortunately it was St. Patrick's day and the place was slammed with a pub crawl. We were sitting at a table outside and asked the manager if he could please ask the people that were congregating behind us to move over a little bit so that our chairs didn't get slammed every time a waiter would need to get by. The response I got was ""it's just the nature of the pub crawl"". Absolutely unacceptable response by the manager of the restaurant. About a half an hour later there was, of course, a problem with the people behind us and they eventually got kicked out when they wouldn't get out of the way of the waitress who was trying to serve the other tables around us. I understand the place was busy but when I ask a manager to help us make it a little more enjoyable I would expect a little satisfaction. All we wanted was him to ask the people behind us to move over a little bit and clear the aisle. After all was done, the bouncer and the waitress thanked us for helping them keep the aisle clear.",1,0

Blackfinn Ameripub,"Restaurants, American (New)",I went in here tonight with 2 of my friends. It was our first bar of the night. Ordered 3 shots; half liquor half juice. And it was almost all juice. Not to mention the bartender with the fancy watch couldn't have seemed more bothered to serve us when he had maybe 3 tabs currently running and no tables in his section. He threw the shots at me and my friends from across the bar. Paid over $24 for 3 shots. Go upstairs to Howl at the moon to get a STRONG bucket for only $3 more and much better service.,1,0

Only to discover later that we got a chicken caesar wrap with broccoli instead of what we did order?? There was maybe 5 other customers in there besides us so it's not like this was a mistake due to being busy Sitting here right now, it just took 17 minutes for a vodka tonic to be brought to our table (the other drink still hasn't came) our server never introduced herself and doesn't come by.",1,0
Blackfinn Ameripub,"Restaurants, American (New)","This restaurant was okay. I went during the middle of a banana bar crawl so you can imagine the noise. Luckily they had a back room and they sat me rather quickly. The food was a good price but it wasn't the best. I ate the bacon wrapped meatloaf, sweet potato mash, and green Beans. The meatloaf didn't have any seasoning so that's what completely turned me off from it. The mash and beans were great. The spinach dip was the best part of my meal. My waitress, Judith, was also very sweet and she took great care of my table. I would go again just to try something else but I'm not really sure what I would get this time but I would try it again.",4,1
Blackfinn Ameripub,"Restaurants, American (New)","My spouse and I stopped by Blackfinn last night when we were told there were no tables available at Fleming's. I'm so glad there weren't any tables available at Fleming's because we were very happy with our meal. My husband loves iceberg lettuce wedge salad and Blackfinn's was huge. He got tons of bacon and really good bleu cheese dressing. In fact, he didn't want an entrée because he enjoyed the salad so much. I had a slightly dry Caesar salad with dressing that tasted good, but needed more dressing. My medium-well ribeye was tasty, but needed a little more moisture. It was supposed to have a butter drizzle, but it needed more. The bacon cheese grit cakes were the star of the show. They were crunchy on the outside and really moist and delicious on the inside. We didn't need dessert because we were very full. Thanks for being there for us, Blackfinn! We'll be back.",4,1

At this point I cut my losses and tried to just pay my tab and leave...yep, 20 minutes later. As I was leaving I overheard a customer irate that they had placed a reservation and an hour past their alloted time they still had not been seated. There are too many options in this location to waste your time on unremarkable food and horrendous customer service. I strongly recommend avoiding this place.",1,0

Blackfinn Ameripub,"Restaurants, American (New)","Stopped by for a light dinner before exploring the epicenter. The place is open seating so we sat downstairs in one of the booths. The booths all have personal televisions attached (very cool). Our waitress was absolutely amazing, I wish I could've gotten her name. I ordered a Long Island iced tea and so did my brother. Our drinks looked completely different. Mine was clear I actually thought she was giving me another glass of water. My brothers drink had the faint brown color. Both tasted disgusting. The waitress said it was because the bartender used lemonade and that she could make it again. I declined and instead asked for a drink nobody could mess up. Or so I thought. I ordered a margarita and so did my friend. Mine looked like a margarita however it was terrible it tasted like soap. My friend's margarita came out next and hers was clear and tasted like salt water. We all sent our drinks back. The waitress kept apologizing even though it was not her fault that they have a terrible bartender. I ended up just getting a lemonade which she completely voided from the bill. I thought that was very nice of her. I gave this place 4 stars because the food was great. For dinner I had the iron skillet macaroni and cheese with blackened chicken. It was VERY tasty. The chicken was well seasoned and moist. Everyone at my able enjoyed their food. I'd definitely come back just to try another item off of their extensive menu, but i think I'm done ordering alcoholic drinks from this place. Hire a new bartender please!!!",4,1

Blackfinn Ameripub,"Restaurants, American (New)","We did a work lunch here with about 20 people. This was the first time I'd been here, the place was pretty busy but thankfully we had a reservation. The service was better that I'd expect for 1 server for 20 people, plus with the rest of the place being packed. The food did take a while to come out but that was pretty much expected with the volume of folks in the restaurant. I always had water in my glass so I was good while waiting. Someone from the table ordered some chips and dip. I wasn't really in the mood for chips and dip but figured I would at least try one. I immediately regretted that decision. The chip was soggy/greasy and there was absolutely no life to it to give it that ""crunch"". It tasted chewy like it'd been sitting in a pool of grease before being dumped on the plate. Gross. I ordered the lunch fish tacos. By reading the menu and being told by a friend these were supposed to be good, I was expecting some really good tacos. You basically get 2 tacos and some rice for $11. You can get them fried or grilled and I ordered the grilled ones. When the food finally arrived I was very disappointed by the portion of fish in the tacos and the overall flavor. I know both tacos combined couldn't have added up to even half of a filet. The person across from me even made a comment when the food was delivered, ""Oh wow you are eating very light today, huh?"". The very small bits of fish were piled on a huge bed of cabbage. When I took a bite I literally tasted nothing but cabbage and since the fish was so small only the 1 or 2 inner bites of the taco had any fish. No avocado or cilantro flavor made it through the overwhelming cabbage. The side of rice had a good flavor but I didn't order the meal for the rice, I was really hoping for some tasty tacos and man what a let down. I felt like I just payed $11 for a mouthful of cabbage. What a rip off. I'm not sure if I would try this place again. Maybe dinner would fare better, but I'm reluctant to try when there are so many other restaurants in the area with better selections. I would rate lower but the server was good and handled the large crowd very well.",2,0

Blackfinn Ameripub,"Restaurants, American (New)","Such a deceptive restaurant with terrible management. I went to blackfinn on Cinco de Mayo and asked the bartender if they had any specials. He said yes and preceded to tell me that they had $2 corona lights and $4 draft beers (not to mention he used his fingers to tell me the amount they would cost, so there was no miscommunication in pricing). I figured the $2 corona light deal was a good special so I ordered to. When I asked for my check (they already had my card so they paid it out) my total was $11. I asked the bartender why it was $11.00 when the other gentleman told me they were $2. The gentleman who told me the special returned and rudely told me that he said $3 (even though he definitely told me $2, besides it does not add up to $11). I then asked to speak to the manager and wanted to pay the price I was told. The manager told me there was nothing he could do except buy me a beer. He preceded to pour me a beer without touching a register (a beer I doubt he comped off, therefore stealing from the bar that he is managing. Definitely not sketchy at all)! I found their customer service dismal. I will never return. They lie and steal your money!",1,0
Blackfinn Ameripub,"Restaurants, American (New)",My guy and I stopped in here for a few beverages and a snack to finish watching the Carolina game and to start a night out for bday fun for my love. This place is A-OK I mean its just a really reliable go to place for food and drinks. They have 2 levels with a bar on each floor. I always end up upstairs for some reason though. They are a little pricey nothing to bad but while I always leave satisfied I'm not like itching to come back asap. I do like that they have a lot of tvs that make it an obvious choice for any sporting event that might be happening. The bartenders are ok they don't say much to you and you may need to flag them down should you need something. The food has always been good here I have to say. The other night I had the steakhouse salad the bleu cheese was outstanding and the steak was a decent cut. My guy had a turkey burger which was really good not a huge portion though which I actually prefer but he was still hungry after the man could eat all day long and not be full.

I certainly don't want to relive that time in my life but it's so tempting at the same time! This is definitely a fun, upbeat, young bar. I went with a bunch of friends and all we did was dance all night long. The music was great, the dj was great and he played a nice variety of music for everyone to enjoy. It definitely was crowded and definitely was filled with the college scene, which if you don't enjoy, I wouldn't venture out here late night during the weekends. It's a fun environment but you have to have the tolerance! Drinks were relatively cheap for uptown in the epicenter. I'm sure I'll make my way back here one night when I'm feeling 18 again and party like it won't hurt the next day!",4,1
Blackfinn Ameripub,"Restaurants, American (New)","Been to both the restaurant and the bar. The restaurant is actually nice and I don't mind it. I wish it was a separate business. The other night, a few friends and I were hanging around Epicenter and one friend suggested Blackfinn for a drink. My intuition responded with a loud ""No,"" since the last few times I've been there, the crowd has been weird and the vibe was off. Admittedly, it's been many months so I thought, maybe I can try it again. When we walked in, it wasn't as suffocatingly crowded as it is on weekend nights, but there was still a weird vibe and I felt a little bit uncomfortable in this place. The bartender was curt and seemed like he had a bad day or didn't want to be working there. One friend ordered water and the bartender rolled his eyes. One thing I appreciated was that the menu has all prices listed clearly. Still, our bill for three drinks was surprisingly high - and we are uptown regulars. If we at least got a friendly smile, it might not be so bad. I know the business cannot control who walks in the front doors, but it's always a consistent situation where other patrons make me feel uncomfortable here. One other individual at the bar was so overtly staring at me (I'm not dressed in any weird or slutty way) that my boyfriend had to shift his chair so as to block his view. As this patron left, he walked so close to my chair as to brush the length of my hair. There was plenty of space for him to walk by without doing that...

Food wise, we had three in our party and each ordered something different: 1) 14oz Ribeye w/garlic butter for side had the greens and mashed potatoes. Overall wasn't bad - green are close to traditional. 2.) Stirfry - vegetables are okay, could have used some heat in the sauce though. Overall the dish was just ok. 3.) pork carnitas - basic food, pork wasn't really tender. Overall - okay. Two people ordered drinks, a rum and coke and a Long Island ice tea and both drinks had two much ice in them and were watered down. The menu feels disjointed from the decor.

We were offered a preselected limited food and drink menu for the group and the choices were awesome. I would have been happy with anything on the menu I think, and the beer/drink ""limited"" selection was hardly limiting. I got the steak salad with Pinot Noir. I was extremely happy with my meal. The steak was perfectly medium rare, just like I ordered and the greens and veggies were very fresh. My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich and it was really great too.

It was served in a large bowl with more than an ample portion of shrimp. So of course he had lots to share. My sandwich was huge. I asked for tartar sauce but after tasting the shrimp sauce, I never considered touching the tartar sauce. The first time we came here, our server was Liam. He was such a cool dude and a cutie by the way. He also made sure we had happy hour drinks. This time our server was Joscelyn. She was so much fun as she helped us with the menu.

Next thing I know, she brings over a dirty dish and sets it on our table while she gathers our dirty dishes. She offers us dessert. When we decline she points to the empty dish and asks us if we are sure we don't want to try the Oreo pie because it's so good. I about fell out of my seat. Who has ever been sold on a piece of pie by pointing to someone else's dirty dish your server has placed on your table. Needless to say, we won't be going back. Any diners looking for a good restaurant in the area, I suggest you keep driving. In my opinion, this is not it!",1,0
Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern","Darn good burger, great fries and a wonderful wait staff. Best place I visited in the area. To top it off, it was very well priced.",4,1
Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern",We went there for a brunch. The breakfast we had was cooked very well plus good flavors. No complants. The specials were great. Wings were .50 nice size and the sauce was a perfect sweeter bbq. My grilled chicken po boy was really a nice taste and size (took half home..)Even the bread was better then I though it would be. Wish it was a little spicier. Service was very accommodating and keep up with our table very well. If I am in the area I will stop again.,4,1
Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern","Second time here for dinner, once more for happy hour. Food is pretty good, portions are reasonable unless you're looking for gut buster meals. Atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. Although on a Monday night the hostess was no where to be found for a few minutes. I had previously had the fried oyster po' boy so this time we went with regular entrees. Bourbon peach salmon was excellent as well as the Mae Mae pasta with chicken. My daughter had the BYO burger which was perfect. Finished with a strawberry shake that was great.",4,1
Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern","So we went there on a whim cause we were looking for a quick place to eat. Pros: The waitress was really nice, we came in towards the tail end of Happy Hour and she made sure that we got our order in before Happy Hour was over so that we could still got the Happy Hour price. Another pro is the milkshakes and drinks. I had the Orange Margarita and the Peach Milkshake, and My mother had the Strawberry Shortcake Milkshake, all three were delicious. Another Pro is that they give you huge portion sizes for a relatively low price. Cons: as far as con's the food while it looked beautiful, the flavor of the food we ordered was just Meh. I ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and the Fried Shrimp Po Boy for my dinner, my meal was edible and good, but it really isn't anything to write home about. My mom ordered the chicken strips for her meal and the pulled pork Nachos for her appitizer. She enjoyed her meal but she's said that the food was just alright. In conclusion we're definitely coming back at a later date for milkshakes and drinks. But I think that we'll pass on the food next time",4,1
Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern","let me start with this, the first time i was at bufords country kitchen was about a week after they opened and the food was FANTASTIC.i had a burger and gourmet shake and the wife had chicken fingers, everything was cooked great and tasted even better. the place was very very busy and my wife and i were extremely pleased with both service and food. this time however, completely different story. my wife and i took our 2 sons, the bar was completely empty, the tables were also empty and there was only 4 booths with people, so it wasnt very busy at all. within 5 minutes of sitting down we ordered an appetizer, the nachos, and our drinks. about 10 minutes later we ordered our food. as we sat there expecting our nachos, about 15 minutes had went by and our waitress comes out with our meals and tells us the NACHOS we ordered were almost done. REALLY??? at that point i told her to cancel them, it was supposed to be an APPETIZER, which if she didnt know what that is, it comes BEFORE the main meal, NOT AFTER. as we are eating our meal, the manager comes over to our table and judging by what she said, we think the server told her something like we ordered the nachos after we ordered our meal. the manager, SUPER nice lady. ok, so now we are eating our meals, ill start with my son #1 had a burger, all ok, not great but ok, son #2 had ribs, again not great but ok, his shake, peach cobbler, tasted like vanilla ice cream with a few peaches in it, very bad. my wife had brisket and choclate shake. brisket was FANTASTIC, shake, not so much. now comes my meal, i got the southern platter....BIG MISTAKE, huge mistake. the shrimp was actually very good, the catfish was very greasy and mushy, the chicken fingers were over cooked, which was noticeable by the BLACK coating and was quite dry.the AIOLI dipping sauce tasted like pure salt. i got the strawberry shotcake shake, which was frozen strawberries in vanilla ice cream, NO SHORTCAKE at all, actually have better shakes at mcdonalds. we also got a burger and chicken fingers to go for the kids still at home. the burger was good, these chicken fingers were actually cooked well. i hope the server we had is somewhat new, if shes not, she needs to get a different job. the manager did take 10% off, but if thats the way food gets served when they are pretty much dead and almost no customers at all, i dont wanna go there when its busy. if i was in charge there, i would never let food like that leave the kitchen. i honestly doubt that i will ever go back, which is a shame, that place was so damn good when it first opened.",2,0
Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern","The first part of the story starts like this - two visits, one a couple months after the grand opening and then a couple months ago. Service was terrible, bartenders were unfriendly - all of the staff seemed clueless and unhappy. Very unwelcoming environment. We weren't going to ever go back. Fast forward . . . September 2016. By accident, we ended back at Buford's and have since been back a few times. They now have a happy hour (5-7 p.m.) with half priced drinks and appetizers. The bartender (Debbie) is friendly, happy, and welcoming. The management staff are new faces - they smile, and seem to care about their patrons. More of a local, casual, and happy vibe now. Although the deep fried oysters aren't part of the happy hour prices, they are worth it - delicious. Fried green tomatoes - tasty. Black bean burgers and fries - excellent. And, nothing was greasy. A successful restaurant is all about good customer service and good food (if you can be ""great"" - even better). If Buford's keeps this up, they may be packed during happy hours and will have no problem gaining more dedicated patrons. Great to have a local establishment to frequent again. Thanks to the owners for making the much needed change!",4,1
Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern","This was the second time we ate at Buford's, we noticed the menu was very different which they acknowledged, we felt the food wasn't as good as the first time we ate there. They had some small mishaps for example no sooner did we get our appetizers which was a house salad and a soup that they told me was chicken vegetable but it definitely wasn't chicken vegetable and it wasn't that good, they brought our Meals out, which like I said was way too soon I was only six bites into my soup but I don't mind something like this so much because I would rather them bring it out to quickly than food sitting in the back under lamps or whatever, but the weird part about that was our sweet potato fries came out cold. The buffalo chicken sandwich I ordered was bland and had an odd smell to it the Cajun meatloaf was good, but overall the food was disappointing. We were rooting for this place, but I'm worried. On a last note the server was great no problems there very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu",3,0
Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern","Wow, lots of fried food. Fried green tomatoes, fried catfish, fried oysters, and it's it's not fried it come with bacon, pork belly, pancetta, or something else fried. So, this is a place you may want to stay away from if you're a vegan, or, a recent heart bypass or replacement patient. I started out with the green tomatoes, nothing special, a lot of salt was needed to add some flavor. Hurricane Katrina, my friend who can never order anything from the menu unless she asks 19 questions and makes 31 changes to the item she orders had the fried oysters. For dinner I chose cheesy shrimp and grits. Again, it lacked salt, pepper, and cheese. The grits were creamy, the shrimp were over done by a hair, tasty though, having seen some Creole seasoning in the skillet. This was a one and done for me. I wasn't impressed and way too unhealthy style of cooking. This is in the former Ground Round building in the Giant Eagle Plaza on University Boulevard.",2,0
Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern","First time at Buford's Kitchen and we all really liked it. Breakfast on a Sunday morning, so we had some time and wanted something good. Waiter was fun and helpful with the menu. Went with his suggestions if the Creole Benedict and the étouffée Benedict. My daughter tried the Presley Pancrepes. Everything was wonderful. The Presley had peanut butter and bananas riled in Pancrepes with bacon sprinkled on top. She loved it. The Benedicts were just right. Flavorful hollandaise on the Creole Benedicts and just enough spice in the etouffee. A nice change for breakfast !",5,1

A friend ordered the catfish sandwich and I ordered the shrimp sandwich. His catfish was excellent! Cooked just right, very tasty it was a 10 as for my shrimp it was ok. The service was great and very friendly, the menu is limited and different for the area but that's good. The décor is industrial look very trendy for the area which is good since we in Pittsburgh are usually behind on trendy. Some people ordered crepes and loved them. Great Green Fried tomatoes! No not like Mom's but excellent in another way! .... stop by & see what you think...",4,1
Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern","I went here, solo, not long after the place opened. To begin with, it was very crowded, and I was seated at a table at a window. Ordinarily I prefer a window table, but this was an extremely cold evening, and they were having a heating problem. As in, NONE, and even cold air blowing. Most people, myself included, wore coats the entire time. I personally HATE to be cold, so this was strike one. When I was given a menu, I was astounded at how limited it was--mainly po'boys and build-your-own burgers, and very little else. Now let me say that when I dine out alone, I rarely check the prices because I choose places where paying a check for one person is never a problem. That being said, I ordered a peach cobbler alcoholic shake and a build-your-own burger. The shake was AWESOME, very flavorful, and you get not only a glassful, but also extra in one of those old metal shake cups. The burger, to which I added cheese and grilled onions, was a goodly size and was very tasty with good melty cheese and lots of onions grilled just right. Then the check came. I discovered that the shake was $10. Okay, it was creative and had a shot of booze in it, but still, it's just a shake! I could see $6, or even $7 if you really pushed it...but $10?? Wow. The total amount was close to $28 FOR ONE PERSON, add on a {generous} tip, and I feel that's waaaay too high for this area. So, given the extremely limited menu and what I feel is overpricing, it's very likely that I won't go back. Pity, really. I was hoping for a great very local place at which to be a regular.",2,0
Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern",Fried Green tomatoes with mozzarella and balsamic. Cajun shrimp and grits. And a Sazarac.

Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern","Holy Trainwreck! I stopped in with my son for lunch during a non busy time expecting so so much more. First it took them forever for the guy at the front to ""find"" us a table. There were only a dozen or so people there. Once seated we had the pleasure of checking out all the ikea lighting fixtures thoroughly while waiting for the waitstaff to figure out if we really wanted eat here or not. Upon ordering our food and waiting about 30 minutes we were informed that they are out of potatoes (I ordered a baked potato with my sandwich) but could instead substitute it with french fries (which are made from potatoes right)? While after another 30 minutes or so our food came out as cold as could be. We attempted to eat instead of asking for another super long wait for another meal. But alas we had no silverware. I found some near the hostess stand and helped myself. Also, I don't think anyone ever refilled our drinks even though we sat there for over an hour waiting for our food. Once the bill came I was still charged for the baked potato.. Ugh. I know this place is new but the lack of disorganization and lackluster service is not an excuse.",1,0

Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern","I'd probably go back for an appetizer and a beer, but that's about it. I've been looking forward to this restaurant opening for months - I love cool burger bars, and this seemed like it would be one. Sadly, I was disappointed in almost everything. Lots of places these days allow you to create your own burger, but they usually offer dozens of different toppings, proteins, buns, rubs, sauces, cheeses, etc., plus they have their own custom burgers to choose from as well. This place has nothing but BYO burgers on the dinner menu, which cost $10.25. Twenty additions are listed, and half of them cost an additional $1.00 each. The server did come right over to introduce himself, and we placed our drink orders. Then he came back to confirm my drink order (a Bud Light). After that he showed up less reliably. It took quite a long time to place our food orders, somebody else delivered our orders, and he never came back to ask how we liked the food. We were one of his three tables at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon. I got the Breakfast Burger, ""add cheddar."" The server didn't ask how I wanted the burger done and forgot to add the cheese to my order (I wasn't charged for it, either). It was an okay burger nonetheless, but nothing special. It did come with a handful of fries on the side - this isn't mentioned on the menu about this burger, or about the BYO burgers. My daughter got the Cream Cheese Stuffed French Toast. We were just totally confused by this item. It wasn't even pretending to be stuffed - just several (six? eight?) half slices of thin white bread French toast with a dollop of something on the edge of each slice. The online menu says it's an herbed goat cheese. Either my daughter didn't read it correctly or the menu in the restaurant was different, because she would never have ordered that. In any case, goat cheese is not cream cheese, so that doesn't make sense. We also shared the Southern Mac 'n Cheese app, which was excellent. The food was mediocre and expensive, and the service was terrible. I'll give the servers a little slack because this location is so new, but there are other local locations, and management should have arranged for the servers to train there for at least a few days before starting at this location. Because they didn't do that, they've had a poor opening, when guests are deciding whether to return and whether to recommend the place to their friends. I wanted to love this place, and will give it another try, but from what I saw tonight, they've got a lot of work to do to make this place great. I hope they pull it off!",2,0
Buford's Kitchen,"Burgers, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Southern","Hopefully they will get better since this was their first night open but... Where to start... Menu takes some time and lots of questions to understand exactly what you are getting. I had a cheeseburger that was just ok. My wife had an omelet that was runny and came with some sort of red gravy that was not good. The kids meals were good but the French fries were extremely over seasoned to the point that I could not eat them and I am a fan of salty fries. Then when the manager came around and asked how everything was, I mentioned the fries and she proceeded to tell me that she had tasted them and that she saw no issue with them. Not good manager skills. Just say sorry about that and get some new ones. To her defense she did get some new ones that were much better. Not a good start.",1,0
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)",This restaurant definitely did not disappoint. Decor is super minimalist with Scandinavian touches. Even the plates were unique. Food was amazing and reminded me of some of my favourite nyc hot spots. Unique flavours and combinations truly makes this a top restaurant in Canada. Loved this place and will be back again!,5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","I've been wanting to try Canis for a while now and my birthday seemed like a decent enough occasion. The food is touted as Local Canadiana and they delivered a well thought out tasting menu that was delicious from beginning to end. We sat by the kitchen and it was interesting to see the bustle of everyone working, but it was very hot. I might not recommend sitting here if you are a Sweaty Betty like me. All the courses were wonderful. I I even enjoyed the bread that they served with chive butter and mascarpone with ramp confit. The wine pairing was the only element of the dinner that I found underwhelming. Normally, I expect a wine for each course. Some of them were meant for two courses and I would have finished the pour with once course in anticipation of the next. The other issue was the 'pour'. Wine was pre-poured and presented at the table with the bottle. I feel like with a menu this nice and service of this level that the wine ought to be poured AT the table. After all, the presentation is part of regular wine service. Grilled veal was succulent. Chocolate and sunflower was unexpected and wonderful. Could have eaten a dozen of the razor clams.",4,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","I am in my 60s and the eight-course dinner we just had at Canis was genuinely the singular greatest meal of my life, bar none. When we first got there I thought it was a bit unusual that there were only two choices on the entire menu - a larger prix fixe tasting menu and a smaller one. Originally wondered about a restaurant functioning with such a limited menu. But that is the genius of it. For the chefs to just concentrate on the same complicated order rather than scatter their efforts and energies preparing dozens of individual a la carte orders, they get things down to a science and achieve near perfection. Every course had so many delicate subtle nuances with distinctive flavors and textures that there was a complexity to it. I got the feeling that this was a real labor of love. We sat at the chef's table overlooking the kitchen and it was a revelation watching this exceptionally happy looking staff practice their mystical art. Service was remarkably attentive and every course brought to us was given a fascinating description by the very diligent servers. This restaurant is a towering achievement.",5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","We came here for the 8-course tasting menu and it was brilliant from start to finish! Excellent job on wine pairing and clever ways of using and pairing ingredients made every bite a delight. The flavours of all the dishes here are familiar yet unique. Awesome job on the plating as well. For a restaurant that is ranked #15 in the top 100 Canada's best restaurants (as of 2018), reservation was relatively easy to come by. Having dined at other ""top"" establishments before, I am surprised Canis did not rank in the top 10, as I can honestly say the flavours here are better. Service was attentive without being over-bearing or pretentious. You can come dine here comfortably in reasonably casual clothing without feeling out of place. My favourite dishes were the dessert, especially the sunflower sorbet with a chocolate wafer on top! Hooked the second I tasted it - so delicious! Highly recommended!",5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","Went in to dine at Canis for an 8 course meal with wine pairing after being recommended about the place by a friend. My bf and I were lucky to be seated at the chef's rail so we were able to catch all the live action of our food and plates being prepared. The cooks, chef, as well as the sommelier were interactive with us in being very attentive, as well as sharing with us where their produce is sourced, and answering any questions we had about the dishes. Every dish was executed and presented beautifully, and the flavors did not dissapoint. The highlights of the meal were the two tarts we received at the beginning of the meal (A beef tartare, sunflower, and egg yolk tart as well as a liver pate tart) which were light but also very flavorful and had a beautiful crisp tart shell. We both also enjoied the lamb as it was cooked to perfection, being very delicious as it was tender. And can't forget about dessert; out of the 3 phenomonal desserts we received - they were all so good, but if I had to choose a stand out, the sunflower and chocolate dessert was super unique and devine as the textures and flavors was something that I've never had in a dessert before. My bf and I did not leave a trace left on the plate haha. Overall an amazing dining experience.",5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","We had the smaller tasting menu and added the duck confit since someone in our group was really hungry! Beef ribs were really tender. I loved the duck. Dessert was a blondie which I didn't care for, but the rest of the table thought it was delicious. Everything was really tasty. We tried an orange wine because we had never heard of that before. It paired well with the beef ribs and duck. Expensive, but I felt it was worth it for the quality and quantity of food. Service was friendly and excellent.",5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","Came to Canis to try the dinner tasting menu. They have an 8-course option for $88 and a 6-course option for $68. We opted for the 8-course to get the full experience. As soon as we ordered, out came some fresh sourdough bread with two different kinds of spread. One was a garlic butter with chives and the other was a ricotta cheese spread with chimichurri toppings. The bread was nice and warm and the outside crisp, which was delicious to eat with the spreads. They have only a small selection of beers, but the burdock American pale ale I got was awesome. A little fruity, very smooth, and went extremely well with the entire meal. COURSE 1 (oyster, uni, parfait). The PEI Savage Blonde oysters were small but had a nice firm meat and tasty. The uni came served directly in the half-shell served on ice, very fresh, smooth, and delicious. The parfait consisted of duck pate with grape jelly with a hazelnut topping served inside a crispy tart crust. The sweetness of the grape jelly melded perfectly with the bold taste of the duck pate, and the crunch from both the hazelnut and the tart crust added some extra texture. This was absolutely delicious, I could eat an entire plate of this! COURSE 2 (salmon, turnip, buttermilk). This was smoked-salmon served on top of a bed of turnip salad with a nice refreshing buttermilk sauce. COURSE 3 (tuna, maitake, snail). The maitake was so aromatic and cooked perfectly to retain a slight crunch. The sashimi-grade tuna was just lightly seared so the inside is still raw and delicate. The snails were tiny but still very flavorful, tasty, and not chewy like some of the bigger escargots. The flavors of the three components really complimented each other and were absolutely delicious! COURSE 4 (mussels, potato, dill). The fresh dill and light cream sauce really went well with the plump juicy mussels. When you have mussels this fresh, it's so nice to have such a light delicate sauce that still allows you to taste the sweetness of the meat. COURSE 5 (cabbage, bone marrow broth). This was one dish I thought could have been executed slightly better. The bone marrow broth tasted like the most wonderful tonkatsu ramen soup that was condensed down until it was extra creamy and rich. The cabbage itself wasn't very special and since it was slightly burnt added a little bitterness to the taste. With such a wonderful broth, the cabbage just didn't do it justice. A few pieces of pork loin instead would have blown this dish out of the park. COURSE 6 (duck, confit, parsnip). The duck confit was an entire half a duck, which is a very generous portion for 2 people. The breast portion was so succulent and tender, and even the bone portion still had plenty of meat. The sauce reduction on the side gave the duck even more flavor. It was rather unfortunate that my steak knife was duller than a butter knife. It was very hard to get the meat off the bone with that knife and I didn't want to let any go to waste! COURSE 7 (pear, almond, buttermilk). The pear sorbet with shaved ice was a little sour but was an excellent palette cleanser after the rich duck entree. COURSE 8 (milk, blondie, white chocolate). This was one dessert that I wasn't very fond of. The salted caramel sauce on top of the ice cream was too salty for me. The blondie was good, but nothing special. Two cold desserts might be good on a hot summer day, but not great when it's minus 10 outside in the middle of winter. Would have been awesome to get at least one hot dessert like a molten lava cake instead. Overall, this was one fantastic tasting menu. There were a couple of dishes that could have been better executed, but the vast majority of the dishes were amazing. Unlike some tasting menus at other restaurants, each of the dishes had a very generous portion size. The single duck dish itself was significantly bigger than most full duck confit entrees at other restaurants. So all of this for just $88 was a real bargain! I would have to say this is one of my top-ten tasting menu restaurants. Will definitely be back again when they rotate out the selection on the tasting menu.",4,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","I liked the simplistic style and look of the restaurant. One of our friends was running late. The server curtly informed us that there was a two-hour sitting policy and that we would have to give our table back by 8 p.m. When A arrived and heard about this, she asked about the sitting time policy as it wasn't noted on their restaurant at all. Another server informed us that since there was another party booked at our table for 8:10 pm, we just had to make sure that we vacated our table five minutes before their arrival. We ordered the seven-course tasting menu. For every course that we had that night, there were at least 2 servers who delivered the food to our table simultaneously. You can expect professional and tailored service here. The first item at our table was the bread course which were three slices of sourdough bread set on a deep set plate for each of us and an in-house made salted chive butter and ricotta cheese with garlic to share. This was incredibly delicate and I loved the wooden serving handles for the butter and cheese. Our first course was a ""tuna, blonde cucumber, green tomato"". This was a salad deep set in a bowl with tuna, salmon roe, and carefully sliced cucumbers and halved fresh green tomatoes. It was an artistic presentation for sure. The tuna was hidden underneath the greens. This was a really fresh dish and I was pleased that there were more chunks of tuna fish within the bowl than I had anticipated. The flavours were fresh and definitely not strong at all. The second course was a ""beef tartare, sorrel, yogurt"". At first look, this dish is just a plain clump of grass. I've never eaten beef tartare in this fashion before with sorrel greens and I found that the texture was very different from just eating the chewy and soft raw beef tartare in previous meals. The third course was ""squid, pea, parcel"". This was a much bigger portion than I expected. Again, the dish was served in a deep dish where the ingredients were presented in the most beautiful way with edible flowers and even some chopped scallop bits (that weren't detectable at all but definitely there). The squid was prepared in ribbons and it made it look like we had noodles at first. I was also impressed with how much squid there was inside this dish! The squid was firm and soft; not chewy at all. The best part about this dish was the hearty broth that was present at the bottom of the dish. We took no shame; we all slurped and finished up this delicious broth before the bowls were taken away from us. The fourth course was a fish dish of ""halibut, lovage, scallop"". I was incredibly impressed with the taste of this dish. The halibut was cooked so that it maintained extreme moistness and firmness with the green sauce bursting into each bite. The greens on top, as R mentioned, were indeed a bit bitter and perhaps the only downfall of this dish. Everything else was delicious! The fifth course was ""beef short rib, broccoli, zucchini"". First, a large platter of the beef short ribs was placed on our table. Meanwhile, we were served the broccoli and zucchini on individual dishes. I absolutely loved the way that the charred zucchini acted as a ""boat"" for the broccoli florets to rest upon. Also, I loved how the stalks of the broccoli were sliced up and cut into squares. This was a delicious beef short rib course! The broccoli zucchini boat was good too but nothing outstanding in terms of taste other than earning dozens of points for its unique presentation. Health-wise, I didn't like that the zucchini was charred completely over. The first dessert was like a palate-cleanser. This was a ""raspberry, buttermilk"". It was called ""buttermilk snow"" by the server and there were edible flowers on this as well. To put it plainly, this actually tasted like I was eating soft snow. It was another highly unique dish! The raspberries had nothing special to them so the main draw of this dessert was definitely the buttermilk snow. Our final course of the night was the ""koji, almond, white chocolate"". This was a classic case of ""saving the best for last""!! In short, I loved this dish! I really like chocolate anything and the white chocolate ice cream in this was spectacular! The texture and flavour of the white chocolate ice cream was rich, creamy, and perfect. It tasted so good. I also really enjoyed the rich almond pieces that acted as art pieces to the dessert too. Such a perfect dessert! To our surprise, we were served a final finisher for the night. These were coffee canelés, ""a small French pastry flavoured with rum and vanilla with a soft and tender custard centre and a dark, thick caramelized crust."" They were really crispy and semi hard on the outside while its interior was soft and custardy. I think it's the perfect place for a foodie willing to splurge on an incredible meal for the eyes and for the stomach. The tasting menu cost $85 for seven courses.",5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","In Toronto we have lots of choices when it comes to restaurants and it is a challenge to stand out. Canis is phenomenal! The server was professional and well informed. The food was spectacular. The menu consists or a choice of two tasting menu's and the table is expected to select the same tasting menu. They were very accommodating with with allergies and food restrictions. The atmosphere is elegant and unpretentious. This is a high end restaurant so expect to the bill to be on the upper end, but that said it is worth every cent. The wine pairings were very good and decent sized pours. Book well in advance as they are very popular.",5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","Easily the best dining experience of 2017. Each bite of the 7-course tasting menu was thoughtful, creative and delicious. Service was incredibly attentive, relaxed and genuine. My partner and I are complete wine-newbies, and our server recommended an amazing Italian red that complimented our dinner. From the stupidly tasty food, to the '90s hip-hop soundtrack, to the personal level of service from Chef Kang and his team, our night was definitely one to remember.",5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","According to EnRoute Magazine, Canis is one of Canada's best new restaurants of 2017. In fact, it is number 2 on the top ten list. I knew I had to try Canis when I saw that it was listed as one of Canada's best. It did not disappoint. The decor was sleek and modern. The restaurant was small and had a very intimate feel to it. The open kitchen made the space feel spacious. (It was fun watching the chef working behind the kitchen.) The service was friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. I did the $85 tasting menu. There were 8 courses (not including the bread). Using seasonal ingredients, Chef Jeff Kang was able put together dishes with unique flavours and textures. The dishes were innovative and creative. Some of the standout included the albacore tuna with artichoke, pork with brussels sprout and Chef Jeff Kang's signature duck. Canis is definitely one of the best restaurants in Toronto. The price of the tasting menu is fair as the dishes are high quality and masterful prepared.",5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","As a single, got relegated to the bar, which just happens to overlook the kitchen. More like watching a ballet than five guys cooking up a storm. Incredible energy and the person who puts the dish together is the one who serves it, at least at the bar. They care, and you can tell it from the taste and presentation. Had the prix fixe menu and a couple of glasses of wine, $125 with tip, and a bargain at the price. Each plate looks tiny, but four courses add up to a full meal without feeling stuffed. Ready to spring for the tasting menu next time.",5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","Super awesome yummy! Why not a five star you ask? Great food- innovative, non pretentious and friendly service but i was freezing and I am pretty regulated when it comes to temperature! The restaurant was really cold and the atmosphere was not beautiful. I hate wood paneling so I have a bias here. That said, I would return for the gracious service and very yummy menu. Please pretty up the space though!",4,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","Had to try Canada's top 2 new restaurant of 2017. Interesting little restaurant (seating around 25) with a lot of energy - feel a real buzz in the air. Open style kitchen- literally. Sitting at the bar I got an unobstructed view of everything - stove, fresh station, prep station that also acts as a dessert station too. Service: Friendly and not rushed. Contrasts how the kitchen and wait staff moving frenetically. Optional starter - A quad of freshly shucked PEI oysters. Order it! So good in October - fat and plump with a dash of horseradish. 0.5 course - Beef tartare topped with uni. Creamy uni worked so well with the beef. 1st course - Venison tartare. Gherkins provided the vinegar enhancement - really enjoyed the crunch it brings. 2nd course - Albacore tuna. Not my favorite dish. I mistook the fish for some form of processed cheese. The capers reminded me of gherkins again. Liked it in the 1st course but not in this one. Perhaps I should tried the duck confit instead. 3rd course - Beef short rib with stuffed Hungarian pepper. Tender beefy taste. Hint of salt provides a dash of sharpness. Sauce is not typical - Mild bone marrow taste. The stuffed Cayenne Pepper is wow! Stuffed with ground meat that has complex spices. I like! Dessert- Frozen buttermilk like a Korean shaved milk ice with dried peaches, honeycomb buried underneath. Not too sweet, slightly yogurt flavor - a real adult taste. Along with a glass of wine, it was close to $100. Overall I really enjoyed the creativity and surprising flavors some of the dishes (0.5 and 4th). This may be one of my first 5 Star rating in Toronto. A must try!",5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","Contemporary, fine, seasonal cuisine in an intimate and casual setting. Service was attentive without being pretentious. Food was sophisticated and inventive without being contrived. One of the most delicious meals we've eaten in Toronto. Four course prix fixe, or 7 course tasting menu, so limited choices. Not recommended for strict vegetarians but as fish eaters (but no meat) we were able to enjoy a celebratory anniversary dinner. Definitely will go back in another season.",5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","Not a single dish disappointed. Not one. It was the perfect blend of comfort and palate-pushing with the cohesiveness of a truly great culinary staff. There's not a lot I can say here because I enjoyed this so, so much. We were visiting Toronto from Philly and were looking for something we wouldn't find anywhere else. Canis was very reminiscent of some of the best elements of BYO culture in Philly (no one can get a liquor license so some of the most well-crafted menus and star chefs have 25 seat BYOs) but with a wine pairing menu that took the guess work out of the process. I'd recommend this place (and, again, every single dish on the menu) to anyone willing to put a little faith in a credible chef.",5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)",Possibly the best overall meal I've ever had. The staff was extremely attentive and super nice. Our waitress also gave us some suggestions for late night drinks in the area. My partner and I decided to go with the four course tasting menu and we chose to try each of the two options for the courses. The squid dish with peas and pork was the best thing I have ever eaten. The koji ice cream with almonds and white chocolate changed my life with its combination salty/sweet flavor. The next time we're in Toronto we will definitely be back.,5,1
Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","Unbelievable meal. We had the four course meal and it was great. The scallops were great but both item on the second courses: squid and duck confit, were off the charts good. Excellent service to top it off.",5,1

Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","My favorite restaurant on a recent visit to Toronto. Small, sleek, modern interior in light wood feels Scandinavian. Interesting wine selection and very creative 4 course tasting menu. Everything we ordered was interesting, beautifully presented and expertly prepared. Portions are modest, perfect for the multi-course format. Service friendly and well timed. Amazing bread service, don't skip it: goat milk butter and ricotta+chimichurri. Favorites dishes: beef tartare, squid in ink, lamb. But all were great. And a very good value for the creativity and effort needed to prepare. Outside the main tourist area so you'll feel like a local in-the-know. Highly recommended.",5,1

It's always a good sign when you really enjoyed the bread they bring you. They bought it with butter and ricotta with chimichurri. Beef tartare was good and I loved it's garnish equally, they put a lot of effort into their dishes and it shows . Mushroom pasta dish in broth was smooth and sexy! Duck for two was presented beautifully and then taken away to be sliced and was very generous portion. All in all very thoughtfully presented and conceived food that was well executed. My only slight issue was perhaps the pacing of the meal, it actually went a little faster than I would have liked since we are fast eaters! I will try to slow down next time!",5,1

Canis,"Bars, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Nightlife, Canadian (New)","Canis is a new restaurant focuses on Canadian cuisine. I was attracted by the beautiful photos of the honey glazed duck, so decided to try it out. Service: very prompt and friendly. The staff and chef clearly explained the ingredients of each dishes when the dishes arrived. The pace was moderate and gave enough time for us to enjoy each bite of the beautiful food. Food: we have tried a a few items on the menu Complimentary sourdough bread with fresh cheese and chimichurri- Bread was served warm and soft on beautiful wooden plate and cutlery. The cheese and chimichurri were both flavourful and delicious. Beef Tartare - Beef tartare was covered by the kale powder and you mixed the garlic aioli, sunflower seeds, pickled onions and chives well before eating. I put the beef tartare on the crispy potato chips and each bite was unforgettable. Ricotta Stuffed Pasta - Fresh ricotta stuffed pasta serve with mushroom sauce/broth. I could smell the fresh mushroom aroma when the dish arrived. The pasta was so juicy inside and sooooo good! The sauce/broth (the texture is not thick so I call it broth) was so good that we finished it all. Duck for two - The chef first presented the beautiful whole duck at the table before he return it to the kitchen to carve and plate it with wheat berry and onion puree. Then, the staff pour the duck jus to finalize the presentation. The duck meat was very tender, juicy and flavourful. I think it is the best duck I haven't had for awhile. I will definitely go back to try other dishes; every dish is well orchestrated and gives us surprise. We need more restaurants like Canis in Toronto.",5,1

My boyfriend and I came in after seeing the review on BlogTO and the food and service totally exceeded our expectations.

Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants","Tried it a few times just in case the first one wasn't the usual experience, but it was... Very BLAND food, Very LITTLE selection.. They don't keep anyone at the carving station, sometimes you have to wait more than five minutes to get a slice of ham or turkey. sometimes they only have one meat on the carving station, never more than two. This is BAD; they need more options. Sometimes you wait forever for a refill on your drink, even if you ask. The machines aren't that far away but I was stopped from getting my own refill -- I had waited more than 25 minutes. I let a whole plate of food get cold because I needed a drink first. I said take this plate please. This one? Why? she asked. I had to say everything got cold while I was waiting for a drink. They have mashed potatoes and ONE other vegetable. SOMETIMES. The rolls keep running out; they have a basket of rolls like you'd have at dinner for four people. The butter is FROZEN. You can't put frozen butter on bread or a roll. The salad bar has more items that the regular food and the deserts are even bigger. They need to double the amount of food for the meal...and give it some flavor. Considering all of this, it is very overpriced. It needs to be less than $5 for what they have and the terrible service they provide.",1,0
Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants","Not good. McDonald's would have been better. Selection was weird. Never been to buffet that didn't have some kind of beef selection. It was just odd things. Tamales looked good but the taste was off. Salad was sad. Pie had that film it gets when it sits sliced too long. Went with two other people all of had different things and none of us liked what we got. Has a lot of potential if the stuff would have tasted good, we could have dealt with the weird choices but alas it wasn't. Totally marking this place off the list of places to return to. No line at 5pm should have been a clue.",1,0
Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants",12.99 plus tax with player card for dinner buffet. The selections were limited. They had Mexican and a little bit of Chinese and Japanese.

Turkey, ham and chicken. There's and omelette station as well as eggs Benedict and corn beef hash as well as spam! Gemma is a great server. Very prompt and always checking in. Definitely not a bad place to relax and enjoy a reasonably priced and good tasting meal. If you're in the area, I suggest this place as it looks newer than most of the area and it doesn't seem too busy. Thanks for feeding me and providing a wide selection of food to satisfy my pallet.

Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants","Terribad. I read it was supposed to be prime rib and shrimp night. At least thats what it said on the website. The only shrimp I saw were in the Asian food area: the shrimp fried rice (flavorless), and fried shrimp (probably the best thing on the buffet).

Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants","One of the benefits of staying and dining in Las Vegas is the budget options available. We look for bargains, so we usually land at one of the Station hotels paying $35 to $55 per night (including resort fees). So we have had the chance to try the buffets at the Fiesta Henderson and Boulder Station. Both had better food and more items to choose from, and they cost less with a Station card. We got a Can Club card after check-in to take advantage of the $11.99 buffet (normally $14.99). When we got to the buffet we were charged the full $14.99 and were told it would have been more without the Can Club card. We checked the hours and date and should have qualified for the $11.99 advertised price. So either the ad was wrong or we were overcharged $3 per person. The prime rib was fine, as were the mashed potatoes and a few other things, but most of the food was average at best. The sushi? Methinks not. The shrimp? Overbreaded and nearing its expiration date. The desserts were below average. Next time we'll take our Station card and go up the street for dinner at Boulder Station if in the mood for buffet.",2,0

Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants","I always receive coupons to the buffet here and finally decided to try it out since I was in the area. Like most buffets, the cuisine is divided between Asian, Italian, etc. and each section has about 4-5 selections. I can say that probably 1 out of the 5 is a ""safe"" selection. Most of the food choices have been sitting out for a while and doesn't taste fresh (what do you expect, really :P). The quality was not very good but I didn't expect much since I was only paying for 1/3 of the average buffet price on the Strip, hah. I'd say the ""build-your-own-tacos"" section was probably the saving grace, and I helped myself to many burritos and tacos throughout the meal. Just add some jalapeños and avocado chunks and you can make anything pretty edible, right? The salad bar is decent and also has salmon, which is alright. Also, the service was surprisingly good. Refills were frequent and consistent. My dad asked for chopsticks and the waiter not only pointed us to where it is but brought it over to us. A few notes: I would go light on the pasta because looks are deceiving. It doesn't taste nearly half as good as it looks. I think for the price and location, it's alright. There's not a lot of other buffets in the area that is worthy of consideration, unless you go all the way up to Green Valley Ranch or Sunset Casino. I have tried much worse buffets in town (think Palms) so I can't complain too much.",3,0

Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants","I ate at the Cannery Row Buffet on Boulder Hwy. on Monday Oct 1, 2012. I had eaten there about a year ago and wasn't impressed then...and it seems to have gone downhill since. My first complaint was, the buffet had been open for two hours and no one had put any utensils for the condiments (No spoons so a person could put onions, sauce, or toppings, etc.). How can someone not have noticed? Second, the fried chicken was so greasy and looked as it had been set out the day before,....and every piece was cut so the back of the chicken was the largest portion of the piece...how can this be? The ""homemade"" meatloaf was similar to the taste of cardboard...except..cardboard had a better flavor. The pizza looked worth a try but tasted like imitation grease and imitation cheese. I had a piece of chocolate cake with ice cream for desert and had no complaints with that. On the up side...there was no line going in and no babies crying or kids running around playing tag as, I being 64 years old,...was the youngest person there. The casino itself had many machines available for play, but I was so dissappointed in the lunch, I left with the intent to return and see if there have been improvements. It's March 8th, 2013 and I read my comments here and have not returned to the Cannery East but will do so again soon to see if there have been improvements and give them another chance",1,0

Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants","I went to the buffet when it first opened and was very disappointed. So after a few years now of hearing that the buffet has changed, I decided to give it another try. One reason is that they had a weekend special where the buffet was only $7.00 for Can Club Card holders. So, was the buffet worth $7.00? Yes it was. Was it worth the normally $20.00 they charge for it? Oh no it was not. Some of the food was OK. Most of the food was very low in quality. I was also a bit confused by the station names. There was the Mexican food station which spilled over to the Italian food station which had almost overtaken the American Food station. I did like the spring rolls and potato soup a lot. The pizza was ok as well as the Orange Chicken. The roast beef though, argh! The beef came out looking like it was 25 lbs of meat. It took a long time to cook and thus it was so dry. Almost no pink in the center at all. Our server was great though. That it why the buffet gets two stars and not just one. Keep up the great service and bring up the quality of the food and I just might go back in the future. But for now, I will just stay away.",2,0
Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants","So the Mrs and I wanted to try a new buffet because we always like to investigate new places for when our family and friends comes to visit. Because let's face it, most tourists think dining in Vegas revolves around buffets! I never really read too much into other people's reviews but I'm really shocked by all the negative reviews! That being said I have noticed there have been a lot of postings and advertisements about this being the NEW cannery buffet so maybe it is dramatically different NOW as of November 2!? I am a huge fan of the ""quality over quantity"" campaign when it comes to buffets, I don't need it to be the size of a football field to be considered a ""GOOD"" buffet, for me I want the offerings to be something unique or if it's the same ol' thing I want the quality and flavor to be good. Cannery Row pulled this off for me!!! This is not the Rio Carnival Buffet where you can get lost in the shear size of the buffet, but there are plenty of stations with a large variety of food and it won't break the bank, a mere $5.99 for lunch! It seems to be reasonably sized to where the product seems to be kept fresh. We went at an odd time, about 3pm, so it was impressive that the food was maintained so well, we also received a dollar off for dining between 2-4 (something we didn't plan but it's good to know for the future). The buffet is completely self serve so you get your own drinks, I like that! I hate waiting around to order another drink or wait for coffee so kudos to them for doing that! They also had some of the best desserts I've had on any buffet. The cookies were fantastic and were only a close second place to the donuts at Boulder Station's Feast Buffet when it comes to tasty treats! We will go back in the future for the Dinner or Breakfast buffet but as for the LUNCH buffet they won me over and I'll be back!",4,1
Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants","Can I give this place zero stars? The only good thing about this buffet is the two for one coupon you can find in the RJ. Okay service. Food leaves a lot to be desired. It's either old and dried out, too salty, too mushy, and/or just unappetizing. This is in a neighborhood with a lot of lower income families. While the price is right, the food is not. Value doesn't just mean the price is low. Value is when you get a quality product for a reasonable price. This is not a good value.

But if anyone paid full price, then I know they're not locals and I feel sorry for them as they make their way to the food. I rate server service based on how many times they refill my beverage. Almost every time I've gone they've been pretty decent, so I give them a 4. For value (fine, I'll base it on if someone actually paid) I give it a 1, because I feel this food is fancy cafeteria food.

Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants","I really like this buffet, but I don't take advantage of their offerings to get the most out of it. There's a baked potato area with lots of fixings so you can make your own loaded potato. I generally don't eat potatoes, so I've passed on this each time although I salivate when going by. The Italian area has a cook to order section with ingredients such as shrimp, spinach, mushrooms, onions, peppers, etc. I generally don't eat pasta, so I pass on this, too! See a trend! I do eat their loin of pork, the pepper chicken in the Asian section was great yesterday, and the pot stickers were good. They have pork nuggets so you can put on your own sweet and sour sauce or Orange sauce which are in containers. The one disappointment was they didn't have these melt away confectioner sugar coated cookies yesterday. I really love those little critters. There's nothing to them, and they almost melt in your mouth. It's such a simple little cookie, but a dessert I look forward to getting. They didn't have any yesterday! I'll return. One of these days one of the bakers is going to be mine!",3,0
Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants","The food here was alright. I mean, it was pretty good for $10. It wasn't the best, but it definitely wasn't the worst. I think that, looking at other reviews, we may have come at a good time. I would eat here again given the choice. There are definitely worse deals on the planet. If you're looking for really high quality food, I'd look elsewhere. The buffet was about what I'd expect. If you need volume, this is your place!",4,1
Cannery Row Buffet,"Buffets, Diners, Restaurants","I've tried to like this place. Really, I have. I tried when it was initially little serving dishes of food that you could help yourself to. The food was good then. I tried it when it switched to family style, where you order a big plate of each dish for like 12 bucks and get enough to feed 3 people per, and can share it... The food was good the first time, acceptable the second time and bleh the third time. When it swapped to buffet? Today was the first time I've tried it. The food was disappointing to say the best. Sean, and our friend and I ended up tossing about half the stuff we took. The crab rangoons were dried out and nasty. The lasagna was simply boring. The turkey was dry, and the desserts failed on so many levels. It's a shame they got rid of the good staff they had a year and a half ago when this opened originally. They also wouldn't accept a clearly marked ""Cannery Row Buffet"" coupon that was sent, because ""That was sent from the north location."" Nowhere on the coupon does it say it's only good at the one location, so technically you DO have to accept it. We didn't end up making a stink about it though. The 1 star is not because Yelp forces me to give at least one (which is bullshit)... The one star comes from the very attentive waiter we had, who knew exactly when to refill our drinks and take plates etc. without hovering or being annoying. Kudos to him and I hope one day he can find a better place to work.",1,0
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants",Went here for dinner when we came to visit our friends that live in the area.

We all enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere and will definitely be back!,5,1

Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","I visit my family a few times a year and on occasion we would drop by this restaurant due to its vicinity. Over the years it has lowered in quality, which wasn't substantial to begin. If you order anything with marinara, it arrives in a pool of water. There is no seasoning to anything- marinara tastes like puréed tomato's, breaded food has zero salt, other sauces are just oil or butter with requisite other ingredients but zero else. I've wondered if it is due to the aged population/customers and it definitely has its fans; I'm not one of them after a decade of visiting and with the other options around within a few miles. It seems a rip-off to me.",1,0
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants",A party of six dined here last evening. We all got veal entrees and everyone was satisfied.

Located on mt Lebanon Blvd, they serve many classic Italian dishes, toasted subs (ahhhhmazing), salads, soups,etc. every time we go here the service is prompt, friendly, and personable. They are always busy with takeout and In house orders. Their pizza is delicious for a quick pick up! They have a full bar and tons of parking.",5,1
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants",Extensive menu and good food were spoiled for me by the unpleasant atmosphere. The host was surly and the waitress was incompetent and impersonal. The staff overall seemed uncaring. We were there mid-afternoon on Saturday and the restaurant was by no means overly busy. I might go back for take-out.,2,0
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","This is, sadly, my first negative Yelp review and I have an extensive history as a lead bartender, lead server / trainer, cook and restaurant manager. I went for dinner this evening and the entire visit was disappointing. After ordering our meals at the table, I stopped by the bar to get a drink and check the televisions. I ordered a Sambuca and the bartender did not immediately know what it was. She asked the other bartender who advised her to ask me if I wanted white or black. I responded white, but was poured black. It was slightly loud, but I believe she repeated white as the woman to my left even heard me say it. Paid for it and insisted on drinking the black as it was busy and she may not have heard me. Not enough to even be upset about. Next, I had ordered wedding soup as I have several times before. This time, it was almost all spinach and very bland. Still, not too bothered. My chicken marsala had arrived and the chicken was chewy and severely overcooked. Still was not going to say anything. Then, the proverbial straw. I had noticed Sam Adams Winter on tap while I was in the bar and ordered one as our meals arrived. Several minutes later, our server returned with an amber coloured beer. Before she even placed it on the table, I told her that this was not the beer I ordered. She left the table and within moments returned with the same glass of beer and said she was told, presumably by one of the bartenders, that this was Sam Winter. I told her Sam Winter was dark and this was definitely some form of wheat or white beer, probably the Sam Spring. She scoffed as she asked me if I wanted it or not. I said no and she walked away with no apology and even showed signs of being upset. As we were almost finishing our meals, she returned and told me that it was, in fact, the Sam Adams Cold Snap I had said it was earlier. This entire back and forth led me to write this review. It seems that the food quality has fallen as has the service and especially the bar staff. As a highly experienced bartender, I can understand not being able to tell the visual difference between different light beers, but to not be able to notice that a white or wheat beer is being poured instead of a darker bock or lager is beyond unacceptable. Even much more unacceptable is to return to the table with the same beer I returned once and telling me it is what I ordered. I highly doubt I will ever give this restaurant another chance.",2,0
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants",Great food. Great service from both management and waiters/waitresses. They really know how to feed and accommodate our hockey group of 25+ guests all coming at once. We'll be back next time we are in town.,5,1

Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","Better than I remember! One of the best marinara sauces I've tried in this area. I got rigatoni with marinara and meatballs. It came with a tossed salad, which was just..meh, and garlic bread. The salads definitely need updated. It was just lettuce, shaved carrots, 2 slivers of pepper, and a tiny ring of white onion. The house italian lacked flavor. I'd try a different dressing. The meatballs were a good size and the marinara was chunky and delicious. The rigatoni was perfectly al dente. The garlic bread was standard. The kids Mac and cheese was very good! Wish it was on the adult menu! The four year old went crazy for it. The fried zucchini was amazing. Steak hoagie was really good, after adding the horseradish sauce. We didn't get dessert but will definitely try it next visit. :) The service was very friendly and efficient. Very happy I now closer. I'll visit more!",5,1

Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","My family and I went to dinner here tonight after years of feeling in-between about it. We used to come here late 90's, we really liked it but forgot about the little authentic Italian place for a while. We went there tonight to celebrate my moms birthday, our server was Krista. She was awesome, she was around asking for drink refills, how everything was, but not too much that it was annoying. We really appreciated that, ask for her! The atmosphere was nice, it started getting busy around dinner time but it wasn't loud at all. We were able to talk and have a good time without having to yell across the table. As far as the food, we ordered some apps, pizza, lasagna and a few other pasta dishes and almost everything was delicious. The home made lasagna was my favorite! It was so hot and cheesy, perfection! The pizza wasn't the best, it could have been cooked a little longer. The tab came to just under $100 which, at first, seems high but we had 2 apps, 4 entrees, a few beers and a piece of tiramisu. Loving this place more and more! PS. Try the wedding soup!",4,1
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","From mediocre to poor. I've been here quite a few times. I've tried, sandwiches and pasta and I did not care for either. what kept me coming back was the fried zucchini with horseradish sauce. They used to be thin and crisp and not greasy. Last time they were over cooked and greasy but I chalked it up to a fluke. Today was my last try. They were so thin all that was there was greasy greasy breading. The only reason to return is to buy a container of the sauce to go.",2,0
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants",Found this place using yelp and saw the reviews. Our first experience was in a Saturday Night the place was busy large groups of families celebrating. We figured we would have a wait but we were seated very quickly.

Saturday night the soup of the day is cream of mushroom I bought a quart to take home for Sunday dinner and couldn't wait to go back for more soup. The price is modest and the portions are big. We will be back.,4,1
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","I've been to this place a couple times now. I know it's been good in the past, but today I decided to try the Carbonara's Colossal calzone. I really wanted a Stromboli instead, but this place like many other Italian joints doesn't offer one even though they offer a very similar calzone. The calzone was good for what it's worth. It's very big, has a lot of toppings inside, but not a ton of ricotta. Overall I'd say a 3.5.",3,0
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","We had a Graduation Celebration there last week (Dec 19th, 2014) with a group of 11 and the food was phenomenal. I have eaten there many times and am always delighted with the food. The service we had was exceptional. I wish I could remember the lady's name. Their sauce is so good. I am definitely going to pick up some at a local store now that I see they are selling it. I had the Chicken Parmigiano which was wonderful and a large, large portion. They happily accommodated my request to have it served over pasta instead of pasta on the side. The New England Clam chowder was excellent and beware their cups of soup are the normal size for a bowl in other places. Garlic Bread that comes with your meal is a large portion too . Other members of our party had the Spaghetti & Meatballs, Lasagna, Steak Hoagies (All the hoagies are huge), Buffalo Chicken Salad, Pasta with Malfada Sauce. Everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed their food. Unfortunately we had no room for dessert this time but have tasted their desserts before and they are scrumptious. My leftovers the next day were very tasty. Best of all their prices are really good so we all left feeling very happy. Will definitely return. Nice to have quality food like this in our neighborhood.",5,1
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","Well, I've been going to carbonaras since before my daughter was born in the fall of 1991.

Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","My fiance and I have been on a quest to find a good italian restaurant in the city of Pittsburgh for some time now. Having almost given up, we decided to check this place out as it is close to our home. Finally found a winner. We were greeted and seated immediately as we showed up as the dinner rush was winding down. Our waitress, Chrisie, introduced herself with a smile and explained the menu and took our drink order. The decor felt a little like a department store but it wasnt oppressive or very outdated We ordered the calamari as a starter. The breading was light and well seasoned, and the calamari itself was cooked to perfection. The portion size was more than enough for the 2 of us, and the marinara sauce was homemade, tangy, and perfectly flavored. We both got wedding soup with our meals. Everything was, again, home made and ridiculously tasty. I got the Seafood Scroglio with angel hair pasta. The sauce was a little too oily for my liking but everything was perfectly cooked (shrimp, scallops, and clams), and the pasta was al dente. My fiance got the chicken parmigiano. The portion was HUGE! The chicken breast was cooked perfectly and was moist, the breading was seasoned and crisp, and the sauce and cheese were fresh. All and all it was an awesome experience, and I will definately be back again.",4,1
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","Wonderful Italian Food., I was just in the mood for a nice plate of Spaghetti, and I was pleasantly surprised, Nice large portion sizes, super fast friendly service. and at the suggestion of our waitress, You gotta have a cup of coffee and the Pumpkin Tiramisu.

Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","I met a friend at Carbonara's for lunch on a recent Monday. The restaurant was slow and we were the youngest there by about 30 years but it was a Monday in Lebo after all. Good for people watching. I listened to two elderly gentlemen discuss teenage drivers and how they still had their permits from the 1950's while I waited. I decided to go with the chicken parmesan lunch special. It came with a soup or salad and I chose the salad. Typical iceberg with onion and tomato. I was surprised by the garlic bread that was brought out with my salad. Old school garlic bread on a hoagie bun but super yummy! The chicken parm was a very big portion for lunch but the flavors were simply okay for me. Their homemade sauce did not blow me away. The chicken was a fried chicken breast. Service was fine. Overall, I doubt that I will go back as there are several other Italian restaurants within 15 minute drive that I feel have better flavors.",3,0
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","I love Carbonara's. They aren't the fanciest but their food is delicious, the staff is friendly and the prices are cheap.

Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","I love me some Carbonara's. It's your local family owned Italian restaurant. I practically grew up eating their food so I might be a little bias. Personally I think they make the best Italian hoagie EVER. The bread is toasted to perfection...crispy, warm and crunchy. I live in VA now and the italian hoagie is cold and served with mayo here, no good. You really can't go wrong. Their marinara is great and goes well with the stuffed banana peppers or baked ziti. I crave the wedding soup and garlic bread on a regular basis. The chicken salad is huge, I recommend you get the fries on the side.",5,1
Carbonara's Restaurant,"Pizza, Italian, Restaurants","Basic pastas, pizza, eggplant parm, etc. I strongly prefer their pizza to their pasta (tip: order pizza with light sauce... they tend to overload it otherwise).

He bounced from the kitchen to the bar and through the restaurant to greet the guests. My wife had the grouper with bronzed cauliflower. It was smoky, seasoned very well and cooked to perfection. I had a pasta dish with scallops and shrimp. The handmade pasta was a perfect al-dente. The scallops and shrimp were excellent. It was a very enjoyable dinner. If we're ever in the area, we'll definitely go back.",5,1
Crystal & Jules,"Restaurants, American (New)","Sigh....what's not to love about this place?! An amazingly delicious and upscale restaurant in the heart of historic Madison. Clean and contemporary decor, amazingly talented chef, and kind waitstaff. My parents took me here for my birthday dinner, and as my third time dining there, I was still incredibly impressed. I ordered their Lemon and Lime Chicken with Roasted Poblano Sauce pasta dish. They hand make all of their pasta which is al dente and essentially perfect. This pasta dish left me full, happy, and ready to return soon. The beer selection is small but mighty with Indiana microbrews on tap. The dessert is deadly good. Top notch food in small town Indiana. I'd be ecstatic to find such good food in a big city, let alone right next door. Love love love!",5,1
Crystal & Jules,"Restaurants, American (New)",Can't do better than this. Fresh and delicious food! We dined here two nights in a row. A first for us! Excellent service as well.,5,1
Crystal & Jules,"Restaurants, American (New)",Great restaurant! Friendly atmosphere! Chef/owner Andy and his Dad were working the night we dined there while visiting Madison for a Folk Festival. Steak Tartar was excellent as were our entrees. We will definitely visit again the next time we are in Madison.,5,1
Crystal & Jules,"Restaurants, American (New)","Cute atmosphere and great service. Kinda wish the beer selection was better but, if you like wine the selection is impressive. I had the lemon lime chicken was good but I liked my girlfriends lobster tail pesto pasta a bit more.",4,1
Crystal & Jules,"Restaurants, American (New)","We recently dined at Crystal and Jules and had a wonderful meal and attentive service from both our server and Andy, the chef/owner. It's very hands-on with Crystal, Andy's wife shuttling between the bar and the hostess station. The shrimp bruschetta is very creative and we even got a brief lesson on what kind of vanilla beans give the crème brulee such an intense flavor. Well worth a trip!",5,1
Crystal & Jules,"Restaurants, American (New)","amazing dinner in Madison, the crab cakes, fondue, scallops, and to finish it all off creme brûlée, were all over the top outstanding, would recommend this place, and I don't do that often. I wish it was closer to home, but I believe it was well worth the 1 1/2 hour drive. Bon appetit to all who are lucky enough to dine here!!",5,1
Crystal & Jules,"Restaurants, American (New)","My husband and I dined here tonight while staying in town to visit the Swiss Wine Festival in nearby Vevay, IN. Our collective summary was ""DANG - wish we lived closer"". We were warmly greeted when we walked in and taken directly to our table. Service was timely and patient (it being our first time and taking a bit to make our selections) and friendly. We had the Costa Rican New York Strip & the Pasta Alfredo with Blackened Chicken. The menu said it was made and rolled-in-house pasta and it was Delicious. The Blackened Chicken spice was wonderfully spicy without being to hot on the tongue. The Costa Rican Steak was equally flavorful having both sweetness and spice. Andrew, Chef and Owner of Crystal & Jules, came to our table to inquire how our dining experience was. This was a delightfully personal touch that ensured that we will make the drive and be back soon.",5,1
Crystal & Jules,"Restaurants, American (New)","With my husband we went to Madison a few weeks ago for a wedding and in the B&B we stayed there was a binder with menus from several restaurants in Madison and the Shrimp and Crab Fondue was what made me want to go and once there and it was not only delicious but we had a wonderful service, our entrees were also fabulous, a nice bottle of wine, Chef Andy the owner was very charming and for me his restaurant is a jewel at the south border of Indiana.",5,1
Crystal & Jules,"Restaurants, American (New)","I went to this place for the first time last Saturday and man I was blown away. The service, the atmosphere, the food. YUM amazing. First! I had the caprese salad. The sweet balsamic reduction across the fresh tomatoes and mozzarella cheese was divine. (Inhaled) Next I had the soup of the day which was crack in a bowl. seriously. Well it actually was Curried Butternut squash soup with pear. I loved it so much I ordered a cup to go. It was blended so well and the flavors just popped. For the main course I had Shrimp and Scallops with pasta and a balsamic reduction sauce. Heaven. The pasta was lightly tossed and the seafood was cooked perfectly. It was really yummy. I choose not to have dessert but I ended eating half of my mothers which was creme burlee in a cup. IN A CUP! heaven with sugar! it was superb Reservations are required or a must. It really filled up and we could only get in with a 5:30 or a 8:30. But it's really worth it yall",5,1
Crystal & Jules,"Restaurants, American (New)","We gad a holiday dinner for four at this lovely restaurant in downtown Madison, IN. It was our second visit to Crystal and Jules. Both dinners were a very satisfying experience. The food is great, the menu has several options to choose from. The server was amazingly friendly and carefully made sure we had everything we needed. The atmosphere makes for nice dining. We and our guests truly enjoyed the experience. It is nice to have fine dining in historic Madison, Indiana.",5,1
Crystal & Jules,"Restaurants, American (New)","We had dinner reservations on a Wednesday evening at this newest spot in town. Located in an older house, the restaurant is decorated in black, white and gray. It is simple and elegant. There is a pleasant bar with a full selection of liquors. The beer list is adequate and the wine list is limited but sufficient. Wines by the glass were only $4.25! Our bar bill for two martinis and three rum and cokes came to $16 plus tip. My husband had the prime rib egg rolls and seemed to enjoy them. He also ordered the pork chop. It was not large but nicely seasoned and tasty. His carrot soup was creamy and delicious. I had the Fettuccine Alfredo and it was quite good and cheesy. If I had one suggestion, it would be to heat or chill the plates according to the dish. The salads were nice. My Caesar was good but would be improved with shaved cheese and anchovy fillets. I ordered a side of asparagus. It was excellent - roasted and served with a perfect Hollendaise sauce. Steve had the cheesecake dribbled with strawberry sauce and he loved it. Dinner was an incredible $56 with tax plus tip. The chef came into the dining room several times. The servers did an nice job and I hope Crystal and Jules makes a go of it.",4,1
Di Manno Bakery,"Restaurants, Bakeries, Food, Italian","Had lunch with co-workers here the other day. I'd say it's definitely the most pleasant casual dining experience you can get directly on the Portage strip between Jane Street and Weston Road. As long as you're not die hard on chicken wings or a submarine sandwich instead of some Italian options, this is definitely the place to choose from over the other limp options lying around. The hours are tailored around the typical business weekday, i.e., they're open quite early in the mornings, and do breakfast and lunch, Mondays through Fridays, although the hours sometimes seem erratic - they sometimes seem to close if it's not a very busy end of the day. I had the impression they should be open over weekends but, there have been many times I have driven by, hoping to be able to stop in, but found it closed. Maybe I'm not early enough driving by on weekends ... The food is typical Italian offerings (although you can get bagels in the morning) - you have the typical panini and pizza, and there are daily lunch specials that are better than your average hot table options. You don't just get a couple of choices of pasta - you will find options like roasted lamb and pork, and a nice selection of fresh vegetable sides and salads. The bonus with coming to a place like this during the work day is that it's cafeteria style service, so, as long as the line-up isn't too bad, you get served quickly, and pay at the cash before you eat - no muss, no fuss with waiting on cheques, tips, etc. The space is quite roomy with lots of tables inside, AND - yay for summertime - patio tables outside the restaurant. HOWEVER, caveat to the diner - you can't have your beer (or any alcohol options) outside. As you might expect of an Italian bakery establishment, you have plenty of great options for espresso drinks, baked dessert items, and gelato, although, I limited myself to my grilled panino for the lunch. Speaking of which, it was a grilled giardino (veggie) and goat cheese sandwich, and it was great! The vegetables (eggplant, red bell pepper, zucchini) were well cooked but not soggy, the slices were a good thickness, and the goat cheese was tangy and fresh tasting. The bread, no surprise that it was tender crispy with a fluffy inside - you can't expect less from any bakery worth its salt! Speaking of bread again, when you take your meal from the cash, you can pick up your choice of white or whole wheat buns and butter to go with the cutlery for your meal. That does mean that you do have to collect a glass and water yourself as well, no table service whatsoever, but, this is very conducive to the business breakfast/lunch setup of the restaurant. You aren't expected to bus your table yourself, either. The staff do clear the tables quickly because of the high volume, so that is perfect for the setup. I'm glad this is a lot closer to where I need to be during the workday than say, the Panera over in the Colossus plaza, because I'd choose this over that anytime. The value for the money is a lot better, and the atmosphere is a lot warmer, fresher and livelier in comparison. Definitely my go-to place for the area. No reason I had not to give 5 stars - I usually reserve that for something above and beyond that distinguishes a business but in this case, it's definitely because it's so obviously better than all the other options in the area. They've reached out to new business customers in the new subway centre with flyers and coupons, whereas all the other business sitting around here do nothing to promote themselves, or offer a good customer experience. This place shines like a gem in comparison.",5,1
Di Manno Bakery,"Restaurants, Bakeries, Food, Italian","Love this place. A staple lunch spot in my office. It's always busy, and always good.

Di Manno Bakery,"Restaurants, Bakeries, Food, Italian","This review is specifically for this gem that saved me in my new job... I recently got hired in the area, and as an event planner for all the functions we host, people told me how they have tried Italian catering places and food was not good at all! So I had a lot of work to do to find a local spot that's great and can impress my colleagues. I got a flyer in my mail and it looked proper, I contacted them regarding their lasagna and pasta, and they were very quick to help. I ordered their Meat Lasagna, Vegetarian Lasagna, and Eggplant parmigiana with a chickpea salad, and pasta salad. I ordered for 30 people, and let me tell you something, their prices are very reasonable and the food was enough for all, we even had left overs and everybody fell in love with the lasagnas and eggplant parmigiana. The salads were perfect, and the chickpea salad is great for any vegans or Vegetarians. The main meals are great for vegetarians but not vegans. I ordered as well an assorted sandwich platter, that comes with chicken, turkey, prosciutto, and a vegetarian. They were all on focassia bread, and holy smokes this bread stayed ALL DAY FLUFFY, and not hard like these other restaurants that you go to, people were having them at the end of the day and their teeth weren't breaking like other focassia bread, and we ordered a lentil salad, and it was perfect, great for vegans too. They also didn't take charge us delivery charge unlike subway who is actually across from us and charged us $20 delivery charge!!! Their desserts are great, cannelloni are amazing, so are their cupcakes, and tiramisu. Honestly for corporate catering they are great and food is clearly fresh.",5,1
Di Manno Bakery,"Restaurants, Bakeries, Food, Italian","Di Manno Cheese Garlic Sticks ** (2 stars) 326 g frozen in a box, 5 sticks. Bought from Giant Tiger I got sucked in by the picture on the box of yummy-looking cheese sticks bursting with cheese. In reality the cheese sticks are mostly cloying bread with tiny amounts of cheese inside. Cooked as directed, they are dry and a little hard to get down. Won't buy again. The store in Concord sounds interesting though.",2,0

Di Manno Bakery,"Restaurants, Bakeries, Food, Italian","I can't think of any reason not to give this place five stars...it's never disappointed me. Since they seem to consistently serve fresh, flavourful and quality Italian entrées, pizza and sandwiches along with good and attentive service, I'd say that is the type of establishment that deserves five yelp stars. I would recommend visiting for low key quick lunches (take into consideration that weekdays are loud & busy), take out or catering. I was really impressed with the breakfast basket and grilled meat and veggie sandwiches that were prepared and brought to us in time for our clients to enjoy throughout meetings. The catering pricing was quite affordable and competitive and the ordering process was headache-free all the way through. Thank you, Di Manno ladies :) Side notes: Cannolis are filled upon order so they stay fresh (I could watch that all day lol, mmm). As far as favourite meals, I would recommend the pizza or the grilled paninis.",5,1

Express Pizzeria,"Pizza, Restaurants","I ordered from here before and had no problems. Food was great! However, this last time I ordered, I only ordered a medium pizza and was notified my order was cancelled. I called to ask why and was told they didn't want to deliver to me in Castle Shannon for such a small order. Then how come on Grubhub it states no minimum for delivery? If they are going to be picky over which orders they will deliver, they need to establish a minimum. Very misleading!",1,0
Express Pizzeria,"Pizza, Restaurants","Called to place an order for delivery this evening, gentleman refused as, ""they were busy and no longer taking orders""! I was surprised and taken aback by this, considering they are a pizza business offering delivery. Will never use this pizzeria again, that's for sure! My recommendation, be sure they are ""not busy"" ~ apparently they do not operate well during these times!",1,0

I pick it up on my way home from work and its still hot bybthe time i get home. Their buffalo chicken rolls are awesome...a lunch time favorite around the shop where i work. Highly recommended.,5,1
Express Pizzeria,"Pizza, Restaurants","We have ordered twice now. The food (buffalo chicken pizza, gyro platter, garden salad and 2-liter soda) was good, fresh and hot. Delivery was prompt, however, both times my yelp order was not completed accurately. We like the Buffalo chicken pizza but didn't want the chicken on it this time...we still got chicken. Twice asked for extra cucumber sauce for gyro but didn't receive it either time. Ordered a Dr. Pepper but received a coke.",4,1
Express Pizzeria,"Pizza, Restaurants","My boyfriend and I ordered from this place via grubhub almost 2 hours ago. We we're incredibly excited about all of the positive reviews, and ordered steak hoagies. After waiting 30 minutes past the estimated wait time of one hour and still not receiving a text saying our food is on the way, my boyfriend called the restaurant. The guy who answered the phone was rude and insisted he had called (to tell us they dont deliver to our area even though we're only 3 miles away and it has our area as a delivery area) and no one answered the phone, and since it was my phone he supposedly called my boyfiend handed the phone over to me. I explained that I did not recieve a phone call and that my phone had been in front of me the entire time. At that point he decided to switch his story and say that he called grubhub and it was their fault. To those that use grubhub, you know that when you or a restaurant have an issue with an order, you contact them or they contact you directly. Upon hanging up with him and talking to the nice lady at grubhub, I learned that he never actually contacted grubhub either. They were perfectly okay with letting us sit here hungry all night waiting for food that would never come. The customer service is why they're getting one star. I don't care if the food tastes like it was made by Jesus himself, I will never eat here.",1,0
Express Pizzeria,"Pizza, Restaurants","I ordered from grubhub and they said an hour to hour and 15 mins for delivery but I got it about 30 mins after I placed my order, So fast delivery. I got a buffalo chicken pizza and it was so good. It have trouble finding one that is spicy and theirs is. Also tons of cheese and buffalo fries. You have to open your mouth real wide to get a bite. I also ordered cheesecake and wasn't to happy about those. I didn't expect them to be homemade or anything but the strawberry one came frozen. The top had ice particles on it and I couldn't get a piece off. Luckily the person I got it for wasn't home to eat it right away so it could defrost. The oreo cheesecake came fine though. I guess they don't sell a lot of strawberry so they keep it in a freeze and the oreo in a fridge. If the strawberry one wasn't frozen I would have give 5 stars and I'll try other items.",4,1
Express Pizzeria,"Pizza, Restaurants","Typical Pittsburgh pizza delivery joint with one exception- the sandwiches are enormous. A whole sub is easily a filling meal for two. My only complaint is that they use ""buffalo fries"" (similar to Arby's fries but waffle, not curly) on their buffalo chicken sandwich. Not enough chicken and too many fries. The pizza is great! Must be the same folks as Venice pizzeria because the menus and quality are identical.",4,1
Express Pizzeria,"Pizza, Restaurants","The search for good hoagies in the South Hills might finally be over! Ordered the two hoagie special out of their flyer - a steak and a buffalo chicken. Both were delicious! I do wish they put lettuce and tomato on the buffalo chicken, but it's forgivable. The chicken and fries were crispy and not drowned in buffalo sauce which I appreciated. Ranch dressing on the side was a nice touch, to keep the bread from getting soggy. The steak was great too, the lettuce hadn't wilted under the heat and the peppers and onions still had a bit of bite to them. Express uses Mancini's bread for their hoagies and it makes such a difference in quality. Delivery was surprisingly quick considering the snow. I'll definitely be ordering from here again - looking forward to seeing if the pizza is as good as the hoagies!",5,1
Express Pizzeria,"Pizza, Restaurants","We received a flyer in the mail today and figured we'd give it a go. This is by far, hands down, the best pizza we have had since we moved back to Pittsburgh!

Famous Gyro George,"Sandwiches, Restaurants, Middle Eastern, Greek, Breakfast & Brunch","I came to Famous Gyro George on a very cold night when the roads were slick. He could tell I was a Vegetarian when I ordered the Felafel. I took it to go and it did not take long; about 15 minute for take out. It was the MOST DELICIOUS felafel that I have had in years (I'm in my mid 60's age wise). It was so good that after I finished it, I phoned the establishment to reorder another one but there was no answer and so I learned that they close at 8pm and are only open M-Saturday and closed Sunday. I strongly recommend this place for their FELAFEL. I even went back today (Sunday) to order 2 more felafels, only to then see that they are close today. Well, it's only around 3 miles from work and it's right on my drive home; so hopefully tomorrow.",5,1

She kept referring to what looked like an ingredient list, measuring and adding each item...SLOWLY. then a couple came in and entered the kitchen area, and she seemed to stop altogether to go talk to them. Definitely not focused on the customer experience. After we ordered there was a rush of several customers, so I feel really bad for them as it was basically empty when I get there and we still waited 30 minutes. The food was ok...nothing special. The grilled chicken on the salad was tasty, but tomatoes were watery with no flavor. There was a good amount of chicken, perhaps too much on the Cobb salad, but other ingredients were sparse...like the blue cheese and bacon. It didn't really seem like a Cobb salad at all. It's quite convenient to my home, but I won't go back...If I'm waiting 30 minutes, I expect the meal to be worth it...It wasn't.",2,0
GreenMix,"Salad, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Food, Sandwiches","Came in to order three dinners & some veggies & flat bread ... Probably about a 60.00 order & the woman at counter ignores me, asks the man behind me what he wants because she knows him. Awesome first impression... I just left.

GreenMix,"Salad, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Food, Sandwiches","I have actually never posted a review on Yelp until today because today, I had the worst meal I have ever had and I had to do something to let others know. If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. My husband and I visited here today for the first time for his lunch break... We both got wraps- I got the smoked turkey and he got the Triple C. We took two bites and could not finish our meal. The ""salad"" that came with the wraps was literally romaine lettuce drenched in a sickly sweet orange vinaigrette and both wraps were oozing with this disgustingly sweet mayonnaise, so much so that we both felt sick to our stomachs immediately after taking two bites and for the rest of the day. The wraps were ridiculously overpriced for such a gross meal... We would have been much better off going to Subway. And healthy? Between the dressing, mayonnaise and cheap meat they use, that's just false advertising. Complete rip-off!",1,0
GreenMix,"Salad, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Food, Sandwiches",No. Just no. My romaine lettuce was 90% stem. The cucumbers were soft and nasty. The 1.00 for extras consisted of a very small portion of bacon and 1/8th of an avocado. The chicken is as processed as chicken can get. I'm talking McDonalds style chicken. Will not be back.,1,0
GreenMix,"Salad, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Food, Sandwiches",This was my second visit to GreenMix. It was just as good as the first visit. Last time I got the build your own panini with the grilled herb marinated chicken. It was fantastic! This time I had the build your own salad with the grilled jumbo shrimp. It was just as yummy. Everything was fresh and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. So far I really like this place and I hope it continues to do well. It's a nice alternative to some of the fast food in the area.,5,1
GreenMix,"Salad, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Food, Sandwiches","I love this location. The Young lady that helped me there is always incredibly intrinsic involving my choices with the menu. Her suggestions are incredible and every time I get a wrap, or a salad it's perfect. The customer service employees there is astronomical. There always willing to help out, make suggestions, and correct things that are wrong, or even assist when I might pick something that I don't not enjoy as much as I thought I would. I highly recommend",5,1
GreenMix,"Salad, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Food, Sandwiches","They offer wraps, paninis and make your own salads. It is pretty healthy and since I'm trying to lose weight, like everyone else for the new year, this place works out great for me. I really like their green chicken wrap. It is a spinach wrap with grilled chicken, spinach, avocado, green apple, smoked Gouda cheese and creamy chipotle dressing. The whole mixture is super good. I will definitely have to come back to try something else on the menu",5,1
GreenMix,"Salad, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Food, Sandwiches",Stopped here on my way home from work looking for something healthy and quick. This really hit the spot. I ordered my husband the Asian BBQ beef salad and it was delicious! Perfect with the Spicy Ponzu Vinaigrette dressing. I ordered the Greek Chicken salad which was fresh and tasty but nothing extraordinary. I look forward to going back and trying more of the menu items. The place is clean and the staff were kind and helpful.,5,1
GreenMix,"Salad, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Food, Sandwiches",I went here for the first time tonight and I absolutely love it!! One of the best salads I've ever had!!! I ordered the chicken Cobb salad on flatbread.,5,1
GreenMix,"Salad, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Food, Sandwiches","Gave it a try yesterday. Ordered the build your own salad which with their $3 chicken came out to over $10. Place felt like they were using a swamp cooler, could not have eaten in so got it to go. Salad was hot due to the microwaved chicken being placed in the greens. Honey walnut vinaigrette was watery and tasteless. Had hoped for better. I guess AJ's salad is still a better deal for fresher food. Will not return.",1,0
Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches","Had a wonderful chai with oat milk here the other day. It's one of the few coffee shops in Madison (especially in the Willy St area) that has parking. The price was very reasonable (3.75 for 12 oz before the addition of oat milk) and the decor is cute- love all the maps! Very friendly staff, will definitely return.",5,1
Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches","Brought to you by the people who brought you Cargo Coffee, Ground Zero gives a cozy, warm, coffee-sipping and catching up on some work kind of feel. There were ample tables, sunlight, and most people who were here had laptops and perched out. Despite all of the people inside, the space was remarkably quiet, but not in a bad way. The cafe au lait was tasty and I grabbed a day old bagel, both of which totaled out to be at an extremely reasonable price. I liked how I was handed a cup of steamed milk and got to fill my own cup with coffee as to have a preferred milk to coffee ratio. I'll most definitely come back in the future, and this is a lovely gem that fits right into the Willy St community. It isn't a super standout must-visit coffee shop in Madison, but it's a solid, local choice.",4,1
Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches",Pretty solid cafe for working in the afternoons especially as you get good light coming in for most of the seating areas. Wi-fi is generally solid and seats are fairly available with a decent number of outlets around if you need them. If you like dark blends the atomic blend is pretty good too.,4,1
Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches","Great for coffee and lunch! Their sandwiches are fresh and tasty worth a stop! Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.

Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches","One of my favorite cafes. From the minute you walk in, the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable, like someone giving you a warm hug. I loved all of the decor, especially the maps. I ordered one of their specials (a different take on a lemonade) and chilled with my BF on the sofas in the back of the cafe. It was a nice place to relax and talk and occasionally watch other people doing the same, or work. Overall, awesome way to spend the afternoon.",5,1
Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches","Got a skin latte and a cranberry muffin. The latte was better than expected. The muffin, however, was terrible.

I said hello to the girl working the espresso machine and she just stared at me. Service was pretty slow considering how empty it was.",2,0
Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches","Lots of sunlight and seating options for relaxing. Some coffee shops (*cough* Starbucks *cough*) are purposefully remodeling interiors to discourage lingering patrons, but Ground Zero recently had a freshening up and still maintains both work spaces and lounging chairs. Baristas are friendly and there's a lot of different coffee roasts from which you can choose. The adjacent parking lot can be a little tight, but that's par for the course in this neighborhood. Right now this is one of my top choices for coffee shops on Willy St.",4,1
Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches",Solid cup of coffee and nice atmosphere in a great neighborhood. I've had the cafe mocha and cafe au lait and recommend either. The coffee is full flavored and not burned like Starbucks. Comfy couches and pleasantly decorated with eclectic collections of maps and cameras. Nice place to study. Ample parking in a neighborhood where that's not common.,4,1
Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches","My first time here was last Sunday, and I kept on having to pull out my shazam app to find out what song I was listening to because I had to have it. I had just so happened to have forgotten my headphones at home, so I was deeply grateful for the snazzy beats that were gettin' my head bobbin'. Today is yet another Sunday, and it is much busier than it was last week, but there was dang near a blizzard last Sunday, so I think that this will be more of the normal flow of things. I have only had their coffee, but I am someone who likes to try out different sweeteners and whatnot. So when I got over to the table with the sugar, I was pleasantly surprised to find white sugar, brown sugar, liquid sugar as well as some others that I am blanking on right now because I haven't had enough coffee quite yet. If you are coming here with a computer or tablet, I would suggest making sure that you are fully charged before you leave the house because, while there are some outlets, when it is this busy, you are lucky to get one. Oh, and if you like to people watch, then there are some great window spots from which to partake in the Willy St. visual delights. I also like that there are all kinds in here, and that it isn't super hipster, studious, trendy, shaggy, business casual and so forth. No need to feel out of place just to get some coffee. Long story short: good coffee but a refill will cost you 85 cents, and snazzy décor for when you zone out from whatever you actually came here to do.",4,1

I brought in a small paper bag with a croissant in it that I had purchased elsewhere, though it was not totally obvious that it was food. When the barista served me my coffee he was like ""I'm sorry, but we don't allow outside food. You can't eat that in here."" RUDE. rude. rude. I'm glad I didn't immediately leave a tip because they get NONE. I don't even think they sell croissants, so WTF? And being rude to me is going to make me want to buy their food? I think not.

They could have a little more breakfast food variety. Other than that, great spot!",4,1

A warm, clean, beautiful coffee house with great drinks, food, and music. Extremely approachable baristas and ambiance, this place is good for both drinks to go and to stay. Wifi, good couches, local pride and a modern vibe without being too sterile. This is the place for real people. I'd recommend the tuna, the chai and brewed coffee. There's a parking lot too, so be aware around rush hour! Best overall coffee house.",5,1
Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches",The coffee is good and the treats are always delicious. The staff is super friendly as well.

Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches",I really enjoy this place. I've been here at least 5 times and the coffee is always good and the baristas are friendly. Additionally there is hassle free parking in back. My only suggestion is that it's not necessarily a good place to meet more than 4 people at once as larger tables are at a premium.,4,1
Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches","This was rated one of the best coffee shops in the Madison area, and I can see why. I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but the smell of all the different roasts they had was almost enough to convert me :-) We had some really tasty sandwiches for lunch.The place was really quiet - a bunch of people alone on their laptops, but it was still a friendly atmosphere. Very eclectic decorations, a nice amount of tables, and a couple couches.",4,1

Ground Zero,"Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Sandwiches","Ground Zero was the first coffee shop I visited after moving to Madison, and it's still a favorite to this day. While there are probably more funky and electic alternatives, Ground Zero is a bright, solid choice for lingering over a Sunday paper, studying, or browsing through one of the many Dwell magazines inhabiting the space. Choose from hot coffee and tea drinks or something cold from the cooler to go along with pastries and sandwiches and soups made to order. Given its location, Ground Zero is popular with Willy Street area residents, grad students, and others of the ""mature"" crowd--weekends can be challenging to find a table amongst the laptop crowd tapping the free wi-fi. Parking is plentiful in the building lot or on Williamson St. One of the only knocks is the hours--closes at 9pm on weekdays and 10pm on Friday and Saturday evenings.",4,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants",It's never busy because of poor location in my opinion but the food was so amazing!! The baby back ribs are the best in town! And are a great price! Yum!! my boyfriend and I ordered 1 full slab of ribs and it comes with 2 sides and Texas toast or corn bread and we both left super full and satisfied for only $26!!!,4,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","This place catered our wedding and it was fantastic! On-time (EARLY actually) and fresh! They have outstanding ribs, sliders, and chicken. But my favorite thing about them is their potato salad. Most likely the best in AZ. And in case you're wondering whether or not my opinion matters, I'm from St. Louis.",5,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants",Terrific BBQ. The longhorn ribs are too die for! They are absolutely delicious. The smoked wings appetizer are tremendous. Everything here has lots of flavor. The longhorn ribs are nice and big with lots of meat. This the second best bbq I've ever had- pappas bbq in Houston is the only place better.,4,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","Tasty BBQ with Super Service and a Good Beer (and whiskey) Selection Celebrated my birthday here with good friends. It was our first time but it won't be our last. This place should be packed with patrons. The beer selection was nicely varied. I liked the Hoppy Bitch but there was a good selection from darks to lights. The whiskey (scotch and bourbon) selection is also good. I typically don't eat many breaded foods but H&H knows how to do the appetizers. The onion rings were excellent while the hush puppies had a bit of a kick and the fried pickle was a unique and delectable Southern offering. I had the ribs which were meaty, moist and smoky without a hint of toughness. The whole table enjoyed a variety of pulled pork, brisket and chicken. Everyone was happy. Choose from three BBQ sauces. The servers were delightful despite our large group of 12. Thanks much for bringing Hogs and Hops to our area. It was a wonderful place to celebrate.",5,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","Visited this restaurant on a slow Tuesday night. We were seated immediately at a fun round booth. The waitress came over promptly and took our order, and our food came out in a timely manner. However, from then on, the service was unreliable. There were no knives on the table and after waiting a few minutes, we had to get up and go to the wait station to get our own utensils. Also, even though there was only one other party in the restaurant, our server was in attentive. The food however, was delicious. We got the 1/2 slab of baby back ribs with Texas toast and cole slaw. All were tasty. The Texas toast was fresh with just the right amount of garlic and butter. The Cole slaw was way above average, and the ribs were tender. We had them cooked in the spicy barbecue sauce, and it wasn't really spicy, but was definitely delicious.",4,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","Somewhat disappointing Cobb salad, pulled pork + chicken tasty but appeared old + cold on wilted package lettuce, would suggest cold crisp romaine, warm the protein, top with egg + blue cheese crumble. Sweet potato was cold over cooked or microwave? Service warm + friendly-",3,0
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","My second visit. 2 stars because the Suh-sweet sauce is amazing, ribs not great but the sauce makes up for it. Unfortunately, the best part of my meal was the Texas toast, which was burnt to a crisp. Please see the picture I added. I can't believe they let it be served out of the kitchen. Where is the quality control? Disappointed. I live in the neighborhood, love Bbq and gave this place another chance long after it's initial opening.",2,0
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","We came here on a whim the day after thanksgiving to get a break from cooking. It was a great experience and a very pleasant surprise. My fiancé got the trio of pulled sandwiches and I got the pepper and spicy sausage sandwich. Both were excellent! The beer selection is also varied and has some beers I've never heard of, which is surprising because I bartended for years. You can tell a lot of effort went into both the food and beer development. The service was amazingly friendly, prompt and helpful the entire night from the time we walked in the door till the minute we left. Overall: Great food, great beer selection and excellent friendly service. Will definitely be coming back!",5,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants",This is one of our favorite neighborhood spots. The brisket is outstanding. The Caesar salad is the best I've ever had. They have a great selection of beer and the whoopie pies for desert are delectable!,5,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants",Went there on Friday evening and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. My husband was served the wrong beer but they did correct that. The chicken was a bit dry. The food was not that warm and both the chicken and ribs were clearly pre cooked with barbecue sauce poured over right before serving. Service was okay. We probably not return.,3,0
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","This is by far one of the most legendary upper end barbecue places I have ever been. Don't be fooled by the classic Decour or modern/country music - this place is all about the food and satisfying your hunger. We went in on a Wednesday and it was relatively quiet. Like most, we assumed that we were misled by other reviewers but since we already drove to the place we decided to try it out. I'm really happy we did so. We got the chicken wings, ribs, brisket, fries, beans, and, most importantly, the potato salad. The food was totally on point. The meat fell off the bone, was very savory and left you wanting to more. With the size of their portions, luckily we had more. But we just couldn't eat it. The staff were very friendly and we were greeted by the general manager who was an absolute sweetheart. She took the time to explain to us how everything is cooked and prepared and why there establishment was different than others. I'm sad to be writing this review because I do not want you guys to go to this spot. If more people found out how good it was then we probably would never get a table. But then again, I would never want this place to not be in business. So if you're ever in the area, or even if you're not, and want some well done, properly prepared barbecue food I highly recommend you check this place out. Odds are you'll end up writing a review that is longer than most as well. Cheers",5,1

Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","My boyfriend and I finally went here a few nights ago to use a groupon that we had purchased a while back. Upon entering, we noticed it was very quiet for it being dinner hour and there was no host/hostess to be found or even a sign stating to seat yourself. After awkwardly standing there for a hot minute, a gentleman finally came to greet and seat us. While being seated he stated they had a 'rush' today, everyone was trying to use their groupon before it expired so they were out of all chicken and brisket items on the menu. This was a huge disappointment. We were left with pulled pork, ribs, or salad. My boyfriend got the ribs and I decided to go with the pulled pork. Both were a little dry and under seasoned; however, their BBQ sauce was decent. Overall their food was nothing id go running back for, but I did appreciate the nice craft beer list they had.",2,0
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","They're starting out great! Once they have an idea of how much they need to prep for service, they'll really shine. I say that because my family and I went in one evening and they were out of a lot of things that we were planning to try. Even though we didn't get our first choices, we were very happy with our second ones. BBQ restaurants can be tricky because a lot of the menu items take time to make and once you're out, you're out. Definitely coming back though, earlier in the evening this time!",5,1

Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants",We went here with a Groupon. WOW!!!! The service was quick and outstanding as was the food. We had an order of hush puppies and two pulled pork sandwiches. The sandwiches had enough pork in each that you could have made another sandwich out of it! The sauce was a perfect blend of tangy and sweet. The cole slaw and fries complimented the sandwiches perfectly. The only improvement that could have been made was to use a bun with a little more substance so that the meat and sauce didn't make it so hard to hold. Friendly employees and delicious food....what more could you ask. We will be back!,5,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","Walked in on a Sunday afternoon while trying to kill some time before our flight for our return home. Nice and close to our hotel and found a groupon so figured how could we go wrong. It was about 4 PM and only about 2 tables were taken. Surprising considering they have a Happy Hour every day that looks pretty decent. $4 small plates and tap beers and wine. I'm always about a good happy hour :) We tried the cheese curds and the wings off of the happy hour menu. Wings were very tasty although the the sauce was not spicy as advertised on the menu. It was tasty BBQ sauce though. I have to say that the cheese curds weren't very good. Maybe because I'm a Wisconsinite and we take our fried cheese curds very seriously. Not quite sure if they were overcooked or undercooked, but they were filled with water that took away from the taste of the cheese. The sauce on the side, maybe a chipotle ranch?, was tasty though and I kept that to dip my fries into. The boyfriend ordered a 1/2 slab of the baby back ribs which he said were very good but did mention that he wished there was a little more meat on them. My brisket was tasty as well and fell apart with my fork. A little fatty but flavorful. The service was good. We sat at the bar and the servers we very attentive and made sure to get us what we needed. 2 big TVs in case you want to catch a game. It's very nicely decorated A turn off was the way the food was served. It's served on a tray with wax paper on the bottom. This tend to tear and I kept finding myself looking to make sure I wasn't getting paper in food. Overall, a good place to come and try and close to many of the Scottsdale hotels and resorts. Solid 3.5 stars!",4,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","Went in on a Saturday night and was seated immediately! This place was surprisingly not busy at all. We were greeted and served super fast! We started with the hush puppies that came out in a cute little basket. They could have been fried a tad bit longer as they were still a little mushy/mealy on the inside, but overall good. Then we ordered the sliders! Again they came out super fast!! This is a good choice is you want to try multiple meats at a relatively reasonable price. Lastly we got the Texas Rib and the grilled corn on the cob! The BBQ sauce and the meat were amazing. Very good flavor. The corn was boiled just a tad too long and a bit mushy, but still editable. The service was fast and friendly. We also pressed a couple of the drinks. The shandy and a mule! No complaints here! Posted several photos and enjoyed the food!",4,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants",Hands down the best bbq spot in az! Brisket was amazing. Wings were so good we had to get another order. Beef ribs were so tender and cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back!,5,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","I was invited out by my fiancee's parents to eat at Hogs and Hops and for once, I purposefully didn't look anything up on here or anywhere else so I could go into it with a fresh mind and I was a bit disappointed. Their old fashioned on tap rootbeer was delicious but they served it in a glass with ice which should not be the case, especially if it's from the tap and it's cold already. You wouldn't put ice in your beer would you? Our table ordered the hush puppies and onion rings as appetizers. The hush puppies were the best part of the meal, it was mixed with a little jalepeno and melted in my mouth. Before this I thought I didn't like hush puppies and now I stand corrected. The onion rings were either well under-cooked or the onions inside were just too thick. The batter was flavorless though covered in seasoning salt (which I enjoyed) and the thick, crunchy onion inside wasn't what I usually expect when it comes to a well-prepared onion ring. It was as if they were opposite onion rings with a crunchy center and soft outside. My dinner was the slider trio with a side of baked beans. The sliders bun bottoms and tops were attached together with piles of meat on top. Isn't the point of a slider plate to be able to enjoy three separate sandwiches? It was difficult breaking them apart, keeping the meat on the sandwich and at the same time trying to separate the pork from the chicken and the chicken from the brisket. The baked beans tasted like they added kidney beans and a small amount of other spices to a can of Busch's and they were so hot (temperature) the entire meal that I could barely eat them. Overall the meat was good but there are definitely better places to get BBQ in the valley (see my other reviews). I was also surprised to see nobody in the restaurant at 6:30 on a weekday. There were maybe 3 or 4 people at the bar and the other party in the seating area knew a few people associated with the restaurant. The service was excellent, they were very friendly and well-attentive. I'm also wondering if their location is what's hurting the business. They used to be Notorious Burger (an item they still have on the menu) but The Shops at Gainey Ranch isn't really a culinary hotspot in Scottsdale.",2,0
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","Tried this place for lunch today, almost drove by because it looked closed - so glad I stopped. Service was fast, food was good and a fair price.

Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants",Definitely had better bbq. Just not very good overly fatty brisket and dry chicken. Pulled pork was good but nothing makes this place stand out to the other amazing bbq places like Bobby qs or little miss bbq,2,0
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","Wow, this is a fantastic new restaurant. We ordered pulled chicken, brisket, beans, fries, and corn. Each item was high quality and delicious. Plus, they have 22 craft beers on tap. The food was all reasonably priced, including a $5.99 kids meal. The decor was nice and not pretentious. Service was great. We will definitely be back soon!",5,1

Amazing brisket, hush puppies, wide array of beer selections. I can't wait to get back and try the ribs. Service was great. Definitely worth checking out if you crave good BBQ!",5,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","The best beef ribs ever! Very knowledgeable, helpful staff, too. Surprisingly affordable, considering the tony Scottsdale location.

Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","Looking for a spot to eat for lunch in Gainey Ranch and happened to come across this place. OMG delicious!! I ordered a combo platter with 1/4 rack of ribs and 1/4 chicken. The side I chose was the baked beans and also got the charred corn on the cob. The platter was only $12 and let me just tell you, you DEFINITELY get your money's worth. I ate everything on my plate. The chicken was tender, the ribs were very meaty. The baked beans were outstanding. Looked like 3 different beans they use and a good portion in a bowl on the side. The bbq sauce it was all cooked in was very tasty. I asked for more on the side and they brought it out right away. I wish I got the names of the staff, I didn't :( But the service was friendly and prompt and it looks like they all help each other out. The owner or chef also came out to ask how everything was, which I thought was a nice touch. I am pretty stoked we have a BBQ place of this caliber in this area, as I don't really know of any in the immediate area. I really hope to see this place succeed and bring in some big business. Amazing, will for sure be back!!!",5,1
Hogs and Hops,"Barbeque, Restaurants","Ok, The place is brand new so some improvement may come in time. My biggest issue is the prices, even for Scottsdale they are a few dollars more than other bbq places, $10 for wings??? Come on now. Service was friendly and they had a nice selection of imports and out of state beers, sadly they only had one local beer which is a major let down. Food was good but not great but that may be improved with time.",3,0
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants",I really liked their lunch bento boxes. Fish are very very fresh and bento boxes consist of variety of food. Great deal and i will definitely try their dinner menu next time.,5,1
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants",The past few times I ordered takeout from this place has gone from decent down to the recent experience and was so horrible that I had to give a review. I ordered the sashimi and sushi combo large. On the phone the lady said it would take 30minutes or so. When I got there early (15minutes before I called) the order was already ready (all packed in a bag). It did not occur to me what was wrong until I got home that both the fish and rice were so hard everything was not edible. Definitely appeared the order was not made fresh. I quickly called the restaurant (still 45minutes before their closing hours) and no one answered the phone. Was obvious a scam. And it was a Monday night and Tuesday they close on Tuesday.,1,0
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","Decided to eat here last minute because they were the only place that took credit card in the entire plaza! Small quiet restaurant that gave off a mom and pop shop. Friendly waitress that sat me down right when she noticed me. Their menu is in a form of a photo album with the name and prices on the corner of the photos. PRO: i finally get to see what i am ordering. No need for ""assuming"" how my food will arrive. CON: i had to flip through, what felt like hundreds of photos just to get to the lunch bento boxes. TIP: bento lunch pictures are at the end. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento ($10.95) and a spicy salmon roll ($5.95). The chicken teriyaki bento came with a miso soup, house salad and ice cream. The miso was delicious. Smooth and you can taste it's not made from powder. The house salad has a mix of radish, cucumbers and iceberg lettuce and the usual vinegertte sauce. The bento box came with two imitation crab meat sushi roll pieces, some seaweed salad, some glass noodle, white rice, 2 pieces of shrimp tempura, 2 pieces of sweet potato tempura, 1 cucumber and 1 eggplant tempura. I think, the chicken was chicken breast. White meat. Not too dry. The sauce wasnt too heavy. The chicken was on a bed of bean sprouts which was unusual for me. The shrimp tempura was not consistent. The first one i had was over battered then the second one was just fine. The spicy salmon roll was good, fresh, not a thick layer of rice and their spicy mayo was nice and cold (just like how i like it). Other than the photo album, the other weird thing was the waitress jusf standing there...staring at everyone in the dining room as we ate... Other than that, the food is good! 3.5/5",4,1

Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","We ordered the special boat B to share among 4 people. The fish was NOT fresh, especially the uni. The tables were very close together. We got a table for 6 people but 2 seats were so narrow that it's impossible to sit. We had 4 people so it worked out for us. But the person at the other table was technically sitting beside me, which I don't really like. Service were okay. Food came out fast. Overall experience was meh. I would not come again.",2,0
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","This is a decent sushi restaurant. I came on a Sunday afternoon for the lunch special. I orders the Sushi Bento box which came with miso soup, salad, 2 pieces of california rolls, some tempura (Veggie & Shrimp), and 6 pieces of sushi. You can choose to substitute all the other fish to salmon for those of you who only eat salmon. The fish is fresh here as one should expect when eating at any sushi restaurant. The price of the bento was only $12 which is decent for the amount of food that you get. Service was a bit slow, but it's okay if you're not in a rush (took about 20 minutes to get our food). The restaurant is a bit small so it does fill up quickly on certain days. Overall, if you live near this restaurant and have a craving for sushi you should come try Ichiban Fish House.",4,1
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","It is really hit or miss. I drive from scarbough to get my craving when I meeting up with freinds who leave in Richmond Hill. I ordered the medium sushi and sushimi boat. Decent selection of fish. Some day the quility is amazing and other days it taste like end of day dales a the sushi place in the mall. Service is typical asain. So don't expect that much. Also bathroom are inside the mall, so don't want nice shoes. When in season They also have sea urchin (uni) In the shell but they only give you four pieces instead of five. But it is still good value. It can get.buay here so go early like at 6 or call in advance for takeout. The mall closes ealry. Some days it is 5 stars with service, fish quility and overall experience. Other it can be brutal with a one star. But better than most in the nothern part of gta for mid priced suahi",3,0
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","Love this place! Ingredients are always fresh and staff their are always friendly. They have become acquainted with me to know that I don't prefer red tuna and that I prefer salmon or white tuna in place of it. The prices here are very fair. Their combo one includes 6 pieces of sadhu, 6pcs maki rolls and I think 4 pcs of sushi - all for $13-14! They serve complementary salad and ice cream with every meal. Love their ice cream as they chill their scoops individually.",4,1
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","Best place to have your sushi cravings filled in markham. The menu is a picture book with the items displayed like a catalogue. As this place is owned by koreans, their korean dishes like the kalbi and bulgogi are excellent as well. I would say if you wanna try something here for the first time, go for the ichiban specials or the bento boxes.",5,1
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","Don't order base on their picture menu cause you will be disappointed. Ordered the small sushi platter for dinner on Father Day, and it took them more than a hour to get 24 sushi on a plate. The sad part is what on the plate is nothing like the picture. Picture showed salmon belly sushi but what they gave was regular grade salmon that I could have had any buffet. When asked why the fish cut doesn't match their picture and why only the cheap fish was given, their excuse was the picture menu is just for picture, and if it wasn't busy she would ask the chef to change it. Lol.. My $27 is better spent at a buffet next time for the same quality.",2,0
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants",Quite busy for a Saturday for take out. On the downside already a bad impression when entering the restaurant. We had to wait 15 minutes for a table when there were visibly empty seats in the back of the restaurant. After we were seated the waiter was already trying to get our order. We just sat down. The menu was hard to navigate. It is a picture album menu. Another down side to the menu is that it does not indicate whether it is a daily or weekend special. As customers beside us tried to order a combo but was denied. Appetizer were standard miso soup and salad. Salad dressing on the salty and garlicky side for me. We ordered the medium tray maki roll combo for $37.95 and the golden treasure roll for $14.95. Sushi taste was good. Rice to fish ratio was good. Rice had right balance of vinegar. The meal ended with complementary green tea ice cream. Overall a good meal besides from poor first impression which is key to returning customers.,3,0
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","I gotta say, not sure if it's part of all the other Ichiban franchises but this if they are, this is definitely one of the better places. I was quite surprised. Blue Fin Tuna set ($35) I actually came here just to try this.This is your real bang for the buck, where are you going to find 5 o-toro sushi, 6 o-toro sashimi, and 6 pieces of neigitoro sushi at that price?! In terms of quality I must say I've had better, but this definitely cures your toro fix. Only thing is when I originally saw pictures on instagram I saw a mix of cuts from the tuna, some looked like chu-toro and not just all o-toro - would have been nice to have a mix. Too much o-toro did make it feel really fatty and was a little too much to have all at once. Spicy Salmon Handrolls ($5.50 each) These were really good. The salmon meat went all the way to the bottom. It was mixed with some tempura bits which added a nice crunch. Unagi sushi and scallop sushi ($6.50 for each pair) The fish were fresh - good quality. The scallops were decent size, not the thin ones some restaurants serve. No Rice Roll ($15) Saw this in the menu and just had to order i! Normally when I go to sushi restaurants I hate it when they stuff the rolls full of rice and I'm usually the type that would start picking the rice out. Totally enlightened me as I never had a roll without rice before! How brilliant. But anyways inside was salmon and shrimp tempura wrapped in thinly sliced avocados, and wrapped it the outer layer. I'm not 100% sure what the outer layer was to wrap the sushi - it seemed too thin to be rice paper. It actually doesn't look too appealing but it was actually really tasty. Service was good, really friendly - the food came fast, and my tea cup was always full which is a huge plus for me since I always drink a lot of tea. They also served complimentary soup and salad, and green tea icecream as well.",4,1
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","Best quality at an affordable price. You can have uni, lobster and a large variety of fresh fish for $60. It's says for 2 people but we never really can finish it all. It is super fresh!",5,1
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants",Worst dining experience ever. They were better before. Our waitress sat at the table right beside us with her friends which is extremely weird. Was not attentive at all and when I waved at her she had to finish her convo first. Never once asked me how things were. Her friends were extremely obnoxious as well eating dessert they brought in themselves. Food was terrible. The sashimi was very fishy and tough. Was not fresh at all. Also have a feeling she was the owner.,1,0
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","Used to come here quite a bit over the years, but it seems to have gone downhill over the years. Ended up here when another restaurant was closed, and was pleasantly surprised to see that it was quite full. Waited for a bit, but got seated rather quickly. A very small interior space, but a good number of manageable tables. The menus are quite unique in that they are photo albums, featuring everything they have in photos. Just a little hard to navigate as they aren't really sectioned off. The photo album also hasn't changed over the years, so some of the photos are a bit outdated. My friends and I decided to go for the boat to get as much food as we could. The fish was quite fresh, but some of the sashimi cuts were so large, it wasn't that enjoyable. The sushi and rolls were amazing though. I have been here a couple times before and found that some of the items weren't that good. The gyoza especially were all soggy and flat. Not recommended. The service was absolutely horrendous though. We weren't given tea when we sat down, and had to ask for it! Our soup and salad came, but we didn't have chopsticks of napkins either. I asked for chopsticks, thinking the server would give us both, but only came with chopsticks. I then had to ask again for napkins. Towards the end of our meal, I requested some more tea, which the same server from earlier forgot. I asked again, just to give her the benefit of the doubt, but she forgot again. She would listen to my request, but then immediately go to do something else! I could tell she was getting annoyed with me asking her multiple times, but if she decided to use her brain, none of this would have happened... Overall, the servers all seemed to hate that they were there and were not very friendly at all. A good place for some a la carte Japanese food, but I would be careful what you order, and beware of the service. The sushi and rolls saved their star rating.",2,0
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","Mediocre, really. Ordered a lunch special - a don katsu bento box - and was thoroughly tired of it only a few minutes in. The don katsu itself was very dry. The sushi was very bland. The tempura, while decent, was ruined by the tempura sauce which had a distinct sweet taste reminiscent of Chinese medicine. Overall, the food looked like the atmosphere and the servers - namely that of blandness, boringness, and lingering hope for something a bit better.",2,0
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","Very nice little place inside ???. Amazing quality sushi and sashimi. Their menu is a photo album so it's very self explanatory. They usually have combos or specials andare pretty decently priced platters. They also serve Japanese beer, sake and soju. It's a pretty small place and seats very little people so keep that in mind. Seats under 60 people. You always get mixed green salad, miso soup and green tea ice cream with your order. Cash order take outs are either 10% off or tax free depends on what they say at the time. So they do get a lot of orders. Call to make your orders. Service is pretty good. They speak Japanese, English and Mandarin. I often come here for special celebrations or milestones because it's not overly priced and you get great quality food. They are not all you can eat. They serve seasonal greatness like oysters, hamachi, lobster sashimi, toro, uni, scallop sashimi, ebi sweet shrimp sashimi, fish liver etc.",5,1
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","The average Yelp rating is 3.5 stars, and I wholeheartedly agree with the consensus. This Ichiban has been in business for as long as I remember the Richlane Mall is opened. I have patronized here numerous times over the years. I believe the one undeniable strength of this restaurant is consistency. The raw fish in sushi and sashimi has been reliably fresh. The fish quality is similar to a good AYCE or slightly better than an average AYCE. The rice has always been supple. The portion is never large or small, just reasonable for an average person. If you are a big eater, prepare to order an appetizer or a roll on top of a sashimi or sushi order. The services is not super fast or attentive. When they do wait on you, the wait staffs are courteous. The waitress is often sensitive and patient with the needs of the children who dine with me, such as warm water not cold, nothing raw, nothing spicy, take forever to go through picture menus, etc... 3.5 stars for food, services and decoration. 0.5 stars for consistency.",4,1
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","Been here a few times and for some reason every time we go, we never know what to order. This is probably just me but I prefer a list for a menu, as suppose to flipping through the photo album one by one per item. It just makes it difficult to order when we order multiple things. Pictures are great tho! The wait staff speak Chinese; as it is located in a Chinese mall. Personally, I thought they could've been more helpful in helping us decide as we had no idea what to order. We had somebody sitting at our table who was vegetarian as well. We asked if there was anything vegetarian, but she didn't say anything. Instead they got us plain udon (with no vegetables) as all the udon had some sort of meat in it. After flipping through the menu, we did find an avocado and cucumber roll - so at least that was something! Other then that, the food was A-OK. This including the sashimi, sushi, gyoza and tempuras we've had in the past.",3,0

My friend and I ordered the baked scallop roll, pizza roll, and the backstreet roll to share. The baked scallop and pizza were really, really good. I didn't expect to like the pizza one as much as I did because it was so strange - pizza sauce and cheese on sushi?! The backstreet roll was meh because it had wasabi sauce all over it. I'd definitely come here again!",4,1

Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants",The food was ok. Nothing special about it. Service was a bit slow for lunch. What was a real turn off was their dessert.

It's expensive but not overpriced because te fish is very good. Lots of creative rolls with fresh ingredients and clever presentation.

Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","This place is pretty good when you're in the mood for some sushi. It's not the best I've ever had but it's pretty good considering the area. I truly dislike many of the sushi bars in RH and Markham, especially the ones who consider it the norm to stuff the roll with mayo. I want Japanese food, not a miniature burger in seaweed with fish and rice. The bento box I ordered was more than satisfying, yet considering the reviews I was waiting for something a little more mind-blowing. Maybe I'll give the Sashimi and Udon a shot on my next visit. For those of you who've never been here before. Be warned, the tempura contains the odd slice of apple. Really. Apple in tempura.",4,1
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","This place is phenomenal. I used to come here all the time back in high school and through first year university. I then stopped due to the influx of all you can eat sushi restaurants. I recently revisited this establishment. Still running, still Japanese, still AMAZING! Upon entering, you see the refrigerator full of fresh sashimi ready for you to consume and the sushi bar with the master slicing away but immediately looks up to greet you with many hellos and head nods. Service can get a little slow during peak hours, especially at lunch as there are many offices around in which patrons will need speedy service. So if you want speedy, show up in a suit with a swipe card. When ordering, if you don't know what you want, fret not my friends but everything is in photo format and all you have to do is point and eat. I ordered a sashimi combo and this is the only place I know of that will give you the rare fishes. Not quite sure their names and along with the typical salmon, snapper and tunas there were other types that tasted wonderful but I couldn't name them for the life of me. Everything was fresh and the food came quite quickly. They do have bento box lunch specials but I would suggest trying some authentic rolls and sushi/sashimi as these are truly a testament to their longevity.",5,1
Ichiban Fish House,"Japanese, Sushi Bars, Seafood, Restaurants","The only sushi place I know that is actually run by Japanese chefs. I think it makes all the difference in noodles, rolls, rice, and even the delicate sizing of fish. You can find many dishes here that I have yet to see in other Japanese restaurants. The chefs bar is located in front of the entrance and you will be greeted by multiple head bobs by at least 4 people upon entering. If that doesn't scream authentic Japanese then you need to leave the country, go to Japan, witness the head bobs upon arrival, come back to Canada, then come back here and tell me it's not authentic! Here you will taste the most succulent fish and most delicious rolls in this fair city. The inside is very small and the location isn't great but the food definitely makes up for it. The inside is decorated in typical Japanese fashion with paper wall dividers and bamboo accents. This restaurant is located in what can only be described as an Asian mall for food. Picture a small strip mall where the only thing located inside are restaurants, a spa, and a convenience store. It is the strangest mall I've ever been to but Ichiban is here so it makes it all better. Overall, my favorite place to grab sushi that isn't all you can eat. When I want some quality sushi or even just quality food I look to Ichiban to dish it out. Prices here are reasonable and more than worth the quality food.",5,1

He looked up at the menu, looked back at us and goes ""uh I don't know"" and then continued to stare at us blankly... well bearded dude, since you don't know shit about your job, let me help you out. It stands for UNWICH. FRENCH. WHEAT, you dumbass. I ordered a veggie sub that was already supposed to come with avocado. I asked the girl making the sandwich to add sprouts, peppers, oil and vinegar, and mustard to it. During the order she also stared blankly at me. So blankly that afterward I told my husband, that girl didn't listen to anything I said. But I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt because it wasn't a crazy request right? Guess what it came with? None of that. They also didn't put in the avocado. So here I am with a tomato, cucumber and cheese sandwich... yay.

I used to work at a JJ's in Flagstaff so I know it's overpriced but I'm lazy lol. It's a Russian roulette if they actually get my order right. It's more often wrong than right. I usually only ever ask for no lettuce, which is apparently too hard to read lol. I get that the job sucks and it's minimum wage, so whatever. But when I worked there my managers would be all over us if we did even the tiniest thing wrong. I guess the standards aren't the same here.",2,0

It's the usual Jimmy John's faire, but slightly less expensive ('bout 50 cents) than their Chandler Fashion location. Now I love JJs, but I need to take them down a half star for all the nonsense going on inside the store. It's very much like the old high school cafeteria. Employees yelling at each other, goofing around and tunes dial up to ear splitting decibels, which makes it hard to enjoy a meal here. We've all enjoyed high school once, once. Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?",3,0

The sandwich maker told me later when I asked again for extra tomatoes which didn't come on the sandwich, ""it's against company policy. "" I replied no problem it's the last time im coming back to JJ's. Over seven dollars for an average sandwich with no drink or chips. No thanks.

I went in earlier than I thought it was because I was craving JJ and all the employees were friendly and happy. Definitely made me feel good being there.

Jimmy John's,"Food Delivery Services, Restaurants, Sandwiches, Fast Food, Food, Delis","I loved Jimmy John's. But recently there is something seriously wrong at this location on Arizona Ave. I always order a Slim 5, its just bread, meat and cheese. But the past 5 times I've ordered this simple sandwich, they manage to screw it up. Its always missing cheese or they give me a #5 with all the condiments on it (im the pickiest eater in world and hate condiments on my sandwich). I can understand how a slim 5 and #5 could get mixed up but the other 4 times, the cheese is missing! How difficult can it be to put cheese and meat on bread? Really now. Maybe if the manager would stop juggling sandwiches, dropping them on the floor then serving those sandwiches to customers, and pay more attention to what the staff is doing, there wouldn't be a problem. But when I see the manager messing around plus 12 employees working, I can't even understand why the hell they forget the fucking cheese!!!! Ridiculous. I called and complained and left a survey for corporate, now they're blowing up my phone trying to ""make it right"" with me, again, for the 5th time. And calling me as much as they have is harassment. This is how you make it right Jimmy John's... PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING. Stop fucking around and do your job, its really not that difficult. You've lost a very loyal customer who came there weekly and ordered catering often. All this because of your negligence over a few pieces of cheese. How sad.",1,0

We bought the most expensive sandwich on the menu and my wife and I had to split it because it was so big. I think the whole dinner including drinks was like $12.00 or something. We loved the food.

We were greeted and seated right away outside in a nice little patio area. The service was o.k. The food was not. I ordered pasta, the sauce tasted like it came right out of a can and the noodles were cold. My husband ordered a sandwich. The bread was hard and stale and the meat inside the sandwich was cold, the sweet potato fries were also cold. It was almost like our food sat for awhile under the lights. We did not eat more than a few bites. Our server made mention of why we were not eating, we told her of our disappointment and no need for a box, she did not ask if we wanted to replace it or even have the issues fixed, she trotted away brought over our bill.. We paid and left. We won't be back.",1,0
Joey & Gina's Restaurant,"Restaurants, Italian, Pizza","I wish Yelp had half stars, because this place deserves 4 1/2! It's clean, stylish, the wait staff is attentive and friendly, the food is great and reasonably priced! And for Mother's day (which was also my mother and I's first visit) they presented her and any other mother in the place with a nice red rose! That was such a wonderful gesture! Mom had the Tuscan sandwich, which she raved about (shocking because she's very picky about her roast beef) and I had the Lucca burger (again, shocking because I usually don't go for the turkey burgers). This one, however was great! Nice and juicy and flavorful! The only reason this review is not getting a fifth star is because of two things: when you order a meal that comes with fries you get the choice of sweet potato or regular. I requested regular but got sweet potato. No biggie, especially when the sweet man that brought the food over rushed back to the kitchen immediately to fix the problem. I'm not a fan of sweet potato, but I did try one and it was nice. The regular fries are good too. The other reason is how you enter the place. You can come in from both sides and it can be kind of confusing coming in from the back (you can't tell from outside though), but we were greeted immediately by no less than three employees, so this is just a small ding. I hope this place makes it; the location is kind of cursed. No business seems to make it past a year, but if Joey and Gina's keeps up what it's doing, it'll sure make the long haul! Can't wait to return and try other things!",4,1

Joey & Gina's Restaurant,"Restaurants, Italian, Pizza","Great location by Harkins Arrowhead. Waitstaff was awesome! Super friendly and fast. I really liked the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant and the patio. Food just fell flat. My daughter and I went after a movie and sat outside. However I think my daughter was allergic to whatever potted plants were on the patio. Anyhow, onto the food. We only had the mozzarella sticks and a pepperoni pizza. The sauce with the fried mozzarella was very flavorful but the cheese was just ok. The pepperoni was perfectly spiced and that was only thing good about the pizza. I think it could've used some additional time in the oven as it just seemed soggy in the center. I hate to send food back at a restaurant for obvious reasons so I choked down one piece and my daughter ate most of her slice. We paid the bill and left. I don't want to trash the restaurant based on one experience so maybe we'll try again and order an entree instead of pizza :)",2,0

When we were finally served, no one asked if we needed anything or if things were ok. So my wife and I split a Pasta dish and a Cesar solid, one drink a piece...$53.00.

We were 8 people and it took over an hour to get served. I had a fish and chip. A generous portion of fries and the batter was crispy on the fish.

Anyways, we were seated and were brought a couple of waters and my wife ordered a drink. She said it tasted like something premixed. Not good at all. We then ordered our lunch. Finally it came. The poutine was less than acceptable, the cheese sticks and smoked meat sandwich I'm sure we're bought at Costco. And the romaine on my Caesar Salad was limp and not crunchy.

I did tip the waitress about 15%, probably shouldn't have, what did it for me was she was already counting the tip before she left the table.

There are too many other places within a 2-3 minute walk to waste your time here.",2,0

Joy Thai Restaurant,"Restaurants, Noodles, Seafood, Thai","I came to Joy Thai restaurant for Thursday lunch. The restaurant is nicely decorated. The service was very friendly and the food came quickly. Joy Thai restaurant prices were affordable. The restaurant was not crowded when I arrived, but became busy afterward. I ordered the shrimp chips and the chicken pad thai. The shrimp chips was good, but not very hot. The pad thai was delicious and not overcooked. Would I come back? Yes, since the food was good and the service is friendly.",4,1
Joy Thai Restaurant,"Restaurants, Noodles, Seafood, Thai","Over rated. Went there because I happened to be working in the area, ordered a padthai, taste is very plain and blend, thai express has better padthai. Asked for spicy and it's not spicy at all. It supposedly comes with shrimp and chicken, $11, it has only 2 pieces of shrimp. Service, the lady is rude. Uber eats has better options.",2,0

Delicious shrimp and scallop app with amazing peanut sauce. Then: Undercooked and Under seasoned beef that went cold really quickly. No knife. over salted shrimp fried rice. ""Green Salad"" that came with the beef was just shreds of iceberg lettuce and a few slivers of red pepper and carrot and a tiny circle of cucumber with delicious dressing. Small portions for price. Smelly spray used by waitress to clean table right next to us while we're still eating. 30 minutes later, I'm sick ass.",2,0

Joy Thai Restaurant,"Restaurants, Noodles, Seafood, Thai","We have been going to this place for almost 10 years. Family-run, it is small and efficient. We usually have the stir-fried tofu, the hot and sour soup. The decor of the place is a bit dated since it has not been renovated all these years. The service is quick on most days, but Friday evenings can be a challenge with a large takeout order list.",4,1

Joy Thai Restaurant,"Restaurants, Noodles, Seafood, Thai",Service excellent. Food is always good and consistent. Ambience is kind of cheap with mint walls and diner chairs. Red curry beef/chicken ($11) is awesome. I think they recently raised the prices though after they upgraded their menus. Edging towards all the rest of the expensier Lawrence restaurants which sucks. Go for the food not the ambience.,4,1
Joy Thai Restaurant,"Restaurants, Noodles, Seafood, Thai","Joy Thai is a great neighbourhood spot and I've been going there for years. What it lacks in ambience, it makes up in flavour. The walls and decor are barren and the restaurant is not often full, however I think they do a decent take-out business. I'm rating it a 4 purely based on food and service but the overall dining experience leaves a lot to be desired. Whether I'm dining in or taking it with me, the service has always been typically Thai: friendly. Their prices are reasonable and in-line with the other standard Thai joints I've been to and so I find it a good value. You can expect all of your Thai standards here. There's no stand-out dish but everything I've tried has been good, even if expected. I certainly recommend this place for take out or for a quick bite however I don't suggest it for a special meal out or even one where you plan on doing a lot of intimate talking as this place is bare and QUIET: no background music or anything and if there's another table seated in the restaurant, you can usually eavesdrop on their conversation. The place is small and in the winter, if you're seated near the door you'll often feel a cold gust of air every time the door opens, even with the new entryway they installed. Anyway, I posted photos of the menu and the last meal I brought home.",4,1
Joy Thai Restaurant,"Restaurants, Noodles, Seafood, Thai","Came here a few times since I recently moved into the neighbourhood. It's a very simple restaurant that has a small town feel to it. It's good for casual, no frills dining. I've ordered the pad thai (a bit too salty for my taste, but extremely flavourful) and green and yellow curry dishes here. The curries were very good - good cuts of chunky chicken and enough sauce for three bowls of rice. I wish the dishes came with rice though cause their sauce is so good. I've never seen this place full since the decor is not that inviting and it is rather dim in there, but I'm glad I walked in and tried it. We never had to wait in line and it's good value for the food, especially in this area!",5,1
Joy Thai Restaurant,"Restaurants, Noodles, Seafood, Thai","I found this place to be awesome. Spring rolls for a starter were fresh, Pad Thai very tasty an the Creamy Red Beef Curry out of this world. This uptown spot is a real gem. We've lived in the neighbourhood two years and were embarrassed it was our first time there. We'll be back soon.",5,1
Joy Thai Restaurant,"Restaurants, Noodles, Seafood, Thai",Inexpensive and great food. Take out Thai is awesome. Give yourself 25 minutes and call ahead.

Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","This place is definitely good for lunch buffet but not for other menu.. I went to take chicken biryani, first it's way over priced and second it tasted like one week old with no flavor in it.. If you are a biryani person, please don't go there..",2,0

We will never return and also tell our friends and coworkers.",1,0
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants",Horrible experience. Food was stale. Service was annoying slow. When we found an aluminum piece in one of the dishes they offered no apologies and then just proceeded to replace the dish. Don't think they care about the consequences of such an incident. Highly advice ppl to not visit this place.,1,0
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","I gave this place the last money they will ever get from me. The quality of their food started out as meh and has become abysmal over the few times we ordered from them. They progressively have made mistakes on orders and tonight was the final straw. We never remotely considered this good authentic Indian as they clearly cut corners. Ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Korma. Asked for Marsala to be mild and Korma to be medium. Also ordered x2 naan... They used the same sauce for both dishes but added a hint of butter and more yogurt to the korma. We seriously couldn't tell them apart at first. Both were definitely hotter than medium instead of what we requested. The naan was stale and hard as a rock. Seriously it was like a cracker it was that dry and hard. We called to explain our disapproval and asked how they would like to fix this for us. Their response...verbatim... ""I asked him and he said he did not put anything more in the sauce."" ""All naan is going to dry out after 20 minutes of waiting"". No offer of restitution. No apologies. By the way...we ordered by phone and I was literally out front waiting 5 min after the order as I was in the neighborhood. I also live 5 min away. Nothing was waiting for 20 min. Naan doesn't turn to a saltine in that amount of time. This garbage they sold us was sitting around for hours if I had to guess. The food sucks. The service sucks more. I suggest yo try Passage to India down the street if you are craving and need a quick fix for such cuisine and save yourself the grief.",1,0
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","Wow. Really great indian food. I had the goat currey. It was so melt-in-the-mouth good. And it was nicely spiced. The garlic naan was very tasty.

Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","Although I have been to this restaurant quite a few times, I was very impressed with how they accommodated our group of 10 without any hassle! For a group setting near by ASU(college campus) in Tempe, the food is great and the atmosphere is very relaxed! We ordered a number of dishes but I really enjoyed the zesty chicken manchurian and biryani as I usually order these dishes! Aside from these courses, I enjoyed the shrimp curry and butter chicken side items as well for the generous serving of thali! Also SAVE ROOM FOR DESERT BECAUSE THE lassis, kulfi, ice cream etc are worth the post-meal scrumptuousness! I plan to come back in the future and give the lamb-based dishes a try in the near future and optimally check out the popular lunch buffet option!",5,1
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants",Favorite Indian food around! Love that they have vegan options! Always enjoy my meal and enjoy trying different dishes. Their samosas are a bit spicier then some other places but really yummy. I love that they have vegan options too.,5,1

Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","I have actually been to Kabab palace a few times now--mostly to humor my family, since they have been partial in the past. However, today's experience tipped me over the edge. We decided to come here for my birthday and the service was beyond poor. Our party of 7 was the only group in the restaurant for the majority of our time there, and each dish came out one by one, about 10 minutes apart; the first person got their food and finished before the last person even received their food. The plates that they gave for appetizers were dirty. The water was not iced and tasted very stale. The sambhar tasted like it had been sitting all day. The paneer dosa that I ordered was tasty and the right level of spice, but was overcooked. Overall, I would like to say that I have given this restaurant one too many chances. Needless to say, I will not be returning.",1,0
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants",Ginger chicken was very good and liked the boti lamb even though it was not fully cooked as per Indian expectations .. They do have a thali option with the lunch and dinner orders which is nice . Biriyani was pretty average,3,0
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","The customer service and wait time for food is absolutely horrible, but let me tell you every minute I waited and twiddled my thumbs and watched the music videos on the tv they have by the entrance was well worth it. I had one of the best dosas I have ever had here. I have lived in chicago and los angles, and the cook who made my dosa shall get my business very often. I hope to shake his hand. I do wish the service and wait time would improve, but why compromise the quality of food. I will wait as long as you want me to.",5,1
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants",Food: good Service: pathetic We went with group of friends on saturday afternoon for lunch buffet. We were waiting for server to show up..but no one did..and finally we had to go and ask server (who was the owner) to come to our table. Most of items in buffet were empty and it was after very long wait (over 20 min) that they refilled it. One of my friend's kid crashed against the owner who was carrying drinks. The lady almost screened at our table and was rude. She came by yelling to take care of kid. Seriously !!! (i understand my friend should have been more attentive with the kid but that doesnt qualify for being rude to customer),2,0

Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","i haven't reviewed many indian restaurants in phoenix, but have eaten at quite a few, at least 10. kebab palace had the best indian food i've eaten in the phoenix area for a long while. most indian restaurants i've tried are three and and a half to four stars from my perspective, but three and a half is typical. usually an indian restaurant is great in a couple areas, and one thing at least is detrimentally lacking, such as spiciness or service. usually, my displeasure especially increases as spiciness decreases (like at flavors of india). it's been a while since i tried kebab palace, so i can't actually remember specifically most of what i ate at their buffet, but i do remember (and can't forget!) that the food was actually spicy and flavorful and hot (in terms of temperature). wow! spicy indian food served hot like it should be, and a large interesting selection of vegetarian options (i usually eat vegetarian when going out to eat). i felt slightly impartial to the decor, too. madras blue walls and chandeliers, with bollywood films showing on the flatscreen.",5,1
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","I've experience something of an about-face on this place. I don't know if the food has gotten better, or my tastes have changed, but now, when I go, I find at least three or four dishes I really like. Curry goat? Yes, please! On my first time going back in almost a year, they had the most warm, moist, delicious gulab jamon (probably butchered the spelling there) I've ever had. Now I have cravings for those tasty little balls (I'll let you come up with your own punchline).",5,1
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","By far my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix so far. (And believe me, I've tried quite a few.) I have had the lunch buffet here and dinner entrees. The lunch buffet had a good variety and everything was tasty. Typical Indian buffet, but done well. For dinner, I first had to try my standard chicken tikka masala which was creamy with good flavor. The tandoori chicken was very tender. Naan was good as well. Nothing special about the inside of the restaurant. It just made the top of my list because I like the food the most.",4,1
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","Arrived at 8:30 for Sat dinner and were given some great suggestions. There was a large family and like 2 other couples at the same time, and all were Indian so we thought it might be good after all. We started with Chili Pakoras, which are fried jalapenos, but spicy ones! The hostess even came out and wanted to make sure we understood what we ordered. Hubby had Lamb Curry, which was in a red spicy sauce-not intense, not bad considering I'm not a lamb eater. I had the Spinach Chicken which was very tasty and the spinach was just cooked right. We made one of our meals into a Thali, which is a big tray with several little samplings and we also had some bread that accompanies the main dish. We had a great time trying out this new food and thinking about recommending and going back. Total was about $30+, not bad for dinner for two on date night. Next time I'd like to try the mango dessert and a drink.",4,1
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","Ah the previous owner sold this joint (to the people from Woodlands?).. how surprising given the poor quality of food they dished out. Now this is a much better Indian fare. With comparison to NY or any other decent place this falls short. But for chandler with all its Intel and Freescale population it is probably currently one of the better ones in the vicinity. So not surprisingly most of the patrons sport an Intel and Freescale badge... my my I would never have guessed. On to more serious stuff like FOOD... Well I would say 70% of the dishes are decent. Unfortunately Its hard to discern which ones. I had to sample each item m in their buffet (lunch) to come to that conclusion. I'll harp on the bad...The Chettinad chicken was horrible, the dal makhni was ""meh""... and the paneer was swimming in oil. Of these I can excuse the dal and paneer... but Chettinad... shame... what a poor representation, given that the owner is... well not from Tamil Nad.. but nearby. However the desert was different ... yippee and the eggplant good....lovely.... Will have to go there once again but I'll try the a-la-carte dinner, that should foment my decision",4,1
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","Note: this is for the Indian restaurant located in the former Afghan restaurant. Also, to clarify, there is NO alcohol served here now. I was very sad when the Afghan owners sold their restaurant--the food was fabulous. That said, I love southern Indian food and was pleased the first few times I ate here under the new ownership, even though they had NO chutneys, lime pickles, etc on or off the menu. Sadly, the quality has been sliding down with each visit. When I went this week with my family, the meal started badly and continued that way. The pappads were awful, stale. When I informed the waitress, she went in the back, then returned saying, ""Oh, we tried to keep them crispy but the kitchen must be too humid."" She didn't take ours back or offer us an appetizer. Instead, they sat there on the table, untouched, until we requested that she take them back to the kitchen. For the rest of the night, I listened to her warn guests that the pappads were a bit ""off."" Good grief. Still, we didn't come for the pappads, so onward. As usual, we ordered a LOT of food: chicken and paneer pakoras, poori chana, butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and more. Alas, everything seemed like reheated leftovers. Not horrible but certainly not what I expect when I pay someone else to cook for me. It's not every Indian restaurant that serves dishes like dosa, utappam and idlis, so I'm sad to see what could be a good restaurant going down the road to mediocrity. Next time, I'll drive the extra ten minutes and go to Dhaba.",2,0
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","Good food. But this is an Indian place.. Why does it say Afghan ?? I had the lunch buffet and it was pretty good. Naan, biryani, 3 chicken dishes etc etc .. A decent variety. Will definetly go back again.",4,1
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","We have a newly over-rated restaurant to talk about; and it is named Kabab Palace (obviously). Okay, so we were expecting this pleasantly surprising Middle Eastern cuisine (especially for the asking price). We went for the lunch buffet: the Afghani bread was as dry as a Saltine; and the curry chicken was also as arid as the climate originating from. All-in-all, everything we ate most definitely lacked the wow-factor that everyone seems to be raving about. Including drinks (but lacking tips), the lunch buffet totaled to $30. We will not be returning. If one would like to experience a tasty buffet at a reasonable price, check out the Taj Mahal (Indian, Pakistani cuisine) in Tempe, off N. Scottsdale Rd (really close to ASU). Only $7.99 with a good spread; the garlic naan bread must be sampled. Oh, and the Indian equivalent of MTV playing in the background is not as loud as some are whinnying about; they are quite ridiculously funny (definitely enjoyable to watch while you eat your enjoyable food).",2,0
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","I have a new favorite restaurant and it is named Kabab Palace. Ok, so I was expecting your typical Middle Eastern fare. I was pleasantly surprised. All of the food was outstanding. The afgani ravioli (aushak) was especially delicious, if I go back I will probably order it as my entree. The server and everyone else there was so nice and so helpful. I want to go back and try the buffet but I'm afraid it can't compare to the amazing dinner I had there with friends. I wish I was closer to this restaurant so I could eat here more often!",5,1
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","My husbean and I have gone here twice, and both times the food was amazing. The second time we went, the owner and his daughter both recognized us even though it had been a month or two. I always end up with leftovers for the next day, and the cilantro chutney they serve with the bread is so yummy. The last time we went, it was rather busy, but the service was still great. Both the owner and his daughter are incredibly friendly and willing to answer whatever questions about the food you have (such as what halal means, what makes meat halal, etc). The Turkish coffee is really good, as well.",5,1
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","This place is amazing. The service is GREAT, I never had less than a half full glass of water. I am a vegetarian, and the three other people I dined with are not, and for the pumpkin appetizer, they put the meat in a separate dish for the meat eaters. It's just nice. The place oozes kindness and helpfulness. I'm not sure if the food is authentic, but it is really REALLY good and the service is so kind and helpful.",5,1
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","Love it, love it, love it. My husband took me here for my birthday dinner, as we'd been wanting to try this place since it opened. I haven't had the opportunity to eat Afghani food since college, and so I was really excited. Kabab Palace didn't disappoint. First, it's adorable, decorated with blue walls, chandeliers and Afghan art. Secondly, they offered a vegetarian section in their menu (it's always nice when they do that, as it shows me the veg food is more than just an afterthought). We ordered the vegetarian ashauk for an appetizer, which was thin ""dumplings"" stuffed with leeks and covered in veggies and yogurt. It was tasty. I then ordered a vegetable special, which was amazing! Stewed spinach with a hint of cinnamon, crispy roasted eggplant with yogurt and tomato, an okra sample and sugar-coated pumpkin roasted and topped with yogurt -- all of it came with a rice pulao. By the way, that eggplant was possibly the best eggplant I've had in my entire life. My husband ordered the sheekh kebab and said it was very good, too. For dessert, we ordered turkish coffee, which was just OK, but it came in adorable china cups and saucers. They also served tea, beer and wine, as well as various juices. The service was very attentive, and the owner was friendly. The restaurant was almost empty around 8 p.m., but I hope business picks up -- I know we'll definitely be back for the high-quality and unique food.",5,1
Kabab Palace,"Indian, Buffets, Restaurants","I've only been here for the lunch buffet, and I though it was above average. The kufta kabob was prepared in a way that I'm not used to but it was good, if not just a little over-seasoned. The chicken kabob was good, but very dry. I don't remember the names of the other dishes I tried, but there were a couple of very good ones, including a rice pudding desert. I suspect the quality of the meats served at dinner is far superior to the lunch buffet...but I can't say for sure, and the buffet wasn't enough of an enticement for me to really want to go there for dinner. It's in an office-like strip mall, so they didn't have a lot to work with. Once you get inside, though, they've done a good enough job with the decor. I try to support local mom-and-pop establishments as much as I can...but this one's just not my thing.",3,0
Le Fumoir Rubs,"Barbeque, Restaurants, Burgers","Heard about this place from a friend at work. His goal was to try the mega burger which had fried mac N Cheese buns, but unfortunately they had none left. Our table ordered a variety of burgers, Texas style brisket and fried chicken on Waffles..yumm Aside from all the tasty mains the sides were pretty good as well, the favourite of the table was the beans, a little spicy and smoky and a perfect side for some good BBQ. For the chilli heads out there I saw a bloody Caesar with ghost pepper, or ghost pepper extract, I don't remember which. either way it's hot enough to blow your lips off. So far this is the best BBQ spot in laval. I saw they will be soon opening a location in montreal.",4,1
Le Fumoir Rubs,"Barbeque, Restaurants, Burgers","In this past year, my choice of eating out has been geared around some healthier alternatives. Having had my fill of many a documentary from Forks Over Knives, Fat Sick and Nearly Dead, Vegucated, Food Inc, etc... I did take the plunge and moved to a vegan diet in Oct. of 2011. I have to say, giving up meat and dairy was not easy, but it did provide a huge benefit. The end result, I felt great. Energized in both mind and body, sleeping was restful, and waking up in the morning was a breeze, losing the extra weight was a plus. I suggest everyone try it at least once. Getting to the point, had I tried Rubs back then, I believe my attempt on the path to better health may have been greatly obstructed. This place is really that good when it come to true smoked BBQ. Don't be fooled by the fakes out there attempting to pass off some boiled ribs or meat doused in a lot of commercial BBQ sauces that are bought by the gallon. Give up the notion that a place like Baton Rouge, Montana's, Bar-B-Barn or Houston's actually serves edible food, they simply don't! Ergo it is for years that I have avoided them at all cost, and to this day I would rather go hungry. That being said, my experience with Le Fumoir Rubs only began because some good friends from far out of town were asking to go out for some ribs. When I heard the foul words ""Baton Rouge"" come out over my phone as a suggestion, I simply shuddered and asked that he call me back in 5 minutes. Low and behold, many a yelper helped steer me towards the light or in this case the smoke that is Le Fumoir Rubs, whereas eight of us experienced for the first time a true blue BBQ place in Montreal. Le Fumoir Rubs, made sacrificing vegan-ism worth it for at least a few hours before I embark back on my path to healthy eating. End result, yes it was a cheat, and a big one at that (there have been a few over the year, Icehouse for one could not be resisted), be it as it may, guilt ridden and all, the food and service here is well worth it. Temptation won out only because of the quality of this meaty, succulent and smokey fare, but I do believe it helps that no one else (so far in my now limited experience) does BBQ so well in this city. Now pass the humus, and throw me a few felafels, Aux Vivres get me a table ready, I'll be back soon, that is New Years resolution my body aches to uphold.",5,1
Le Fumoir Rubs,"Barbeque, Restaurants, Burgers",Drove out of my way back in sept just to try the food out based on a friends recommendation.

Dorothy ordered smoked brisket with fries and fried mac 'n cheese. Alice ordered smoked brisket with smoked mac 'n cheese and smoked veggies. Imran ordered smoked shrimp with fries and mac 'n cheese. And I ordered the baby back ribs special with fries and mac 'n cheese. Everything was good! There was sooooo much food and none of us finished our meals. But you can't go to a smokehouse and not order ice cream with chocolate dipped bacon to share! I'd never had chocolate covered bacon before so, as full as I was, had to try a bite. Though tasty, we all agreed that there was too much chocolate (I can't believe I'm saying that!) and nuts so we couldn't taste the bacon. For a balance, we also ordered chocolate cake which was good. Our server took good care of us and at one point the manager came over to chat and make sure everything was okay.",4,1

We also enjoyed a tantalizing taste of ""bar bacon"" basically bits of roasted bacon fat. o.m.g. amazing again! Love love love this place and cannot wait to go back.

So huge that I went the next day and ordered just the sliders for my girlfriend and I to share, and we were both satisfied. The smokiness is just enough to add a delicious flavour and not overpower the meat. You can taste the difference between meats as the smoke is just right. Sweet potato fries were great. Mac and cheese was creamy (very kraft dinner like) but with smokey flavour. If I were to go back the 3rd time, I will get either the beef ribs or the brisket sandwich. The fattiness of the brisket realy won me over, it was divine. Can't wait to go back! Prince Arthur is back. Btw - the watiers are the nicest people ever. There is always an owner about,happy to greet you as you walk in. They seem very proud of their restaurant and their food.",5,1
Le Fumoir Rubs,"Barbeque, Restaurants, Burgers","I have been here several times and I must admit, it's amazing. I haven't been disappointed with one meal so far and the portions are very generous, I tend to bring food back home and have a nice lunch the next day. And the prices are great, I recommend this restaurant to many of my friends.",5,1
Le Fumoir Rubs,"Barbeque, Restaurants, Burgers",Yey finally a decent place to eat on prince arthur.. Get smoked poutine - as its super yummy and cheap.. decent drink selection - 5 beers + cocktails (including decently priced pitchers - about $18) You might not fall in love with this place but you will definitely walk away satisfied without breaking your wallet.. and surely come back for more...,4,1
Le Fumoir Rubs,"Barbeque, Restaurants, Burgers","Great location, rustic ambiance and just a great night filled with amazing food! Had the plate of sliders (pulled pork is drool-worthy), jalapeno appetizer (yumm) and their drinks are huge and yummy. The side dishes, smoked veggies and smoked mac an cheese were awesome :) service was great and my family had a great night. As for the dishes..they were spotless so don't see how anyone can complain of them being dirty. A must try resto in montreal",5,1
Le Fumoir Rubs,"Barbeque, Restaurants, Burgers","Oh my, so delicious! I was wandering around St-Laurent during a street fair and decided to check out Prince Arthur street for any new restaurants and low and behold, this fabulous American BBQ is right around the corner! Extremely pleased with the whole experience. My companion claimed the pork ribs were the best ever had and my smoked chicken was so tender and juicy it was falling off the bones. Side dishes are superb, mac and cheese with a hint of smokiness is nice and creamy, not an overpowering cheese combo (cheddar and gouda). Sweet potato fries were fresh, beautifully orange and ""plump"". None of that wrinkly, dried or soggy stuff you'll find in some other places. Regular french fries were also amazing. Food is delicious so we'll definitely be back for more and service is something remarkable as well. Our orders were fast to arrive and staff was friendly and welcoming. Everyone was all smiles from the entrance to our exit! Our waitress in particular did a great job explaining the food and even custom picked a cocktail for me. Drinks are the only thing I wish they expanded more on their menu. I saw quite a few people with fun looking cocktails in mason jars or margaritas but there are no mentions of the specials anywhere so you have to ask the staff. Perks for liking them on Facebook - they were offering complimentary bacon bits, seasoned with their dry spiced rub (I personally found too spicy). Prices are reasonable, the atmosphere and decor is quite warm and laid back. Everything has this rustic, wooden, barn feel to it which matches the BBQ concept perfectly. I've seen many restaurants fail in that area other the years but I'm hopeful this one will be a classic- Rubs Steakhouse has all the right ingredients to succeed.",5,1
Le Fumoir Rubs,"Barbeque, Restaurants, Burgers","This place should have a sign out front that says incredible lunch $13. Was here while on holiday in Montreal, the brisket was awesome and you have the choice of 2 sides, i had smoked beans and sweat potato fries, more food than i could eat. Couple of pints of Creemore beer and you have the makings of a great time. The staff were also great.",5,1
Le Fumoir Rubs,"Barbeque, Restaurants, Burgers","Closed! Another great newcomer, we went here to try out the new kid on the block and I am happy to report they are going to be a new must try. We were three and wanted to sample as much as possible so we ordered large, what we did not know if that every dish is a huge and generous portions, so be sure your hungry. We sampled the ribs of course both porc and beef, the winner for us was the pork, but we are partial to the pig so it is expected. Next on the list were the chicken wings, they were good and had a great smokyness we asked for some hot sauce and were given two kinds one in a jar and one homemade, the house sauce was by far the best, yes it's hot (which is good), but was also really tasty (me thinks coriander but I could be wrong) do try it. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was great but I did have to forgo the bread, sometimed you have to pick your battles I went for the protein. The sides choices were mac and cheese, fried sweet potato, french fries, smoked beans, coleslaw, and grilled veggies, all tasty my faves were the beans, fries, and grilled veggies (corn on the cobb was really good). As for the cocktails you must try the mexican bomb (Margerita with a corona inside), and the strawberry/lemonade with vodka slush.... The place is nice and spacious and the owners and waitstaff are super friendly, one can tell they care about their clients and food, and want to satisfy, which they do, so kudos to them and let's pass on the love fellow yelpers, fyi, the prices are really reasonable for the quality and uniqueness, this place definately rubbed me the right way",5,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","This hidden gem within the Yard is sure to become a huge hit considering the experience a friend and I had last night. We received the best service, hands down, at a restaurant in a long time. Grady bent over backwards to make sure we had an incredible evening. We sat outside and enjoyed an unseasonably cool August evening...how lucky for us! We enjoyed the hummus, jamon & manchego plate, white sangria, gambas and a side of the spinach and chickpeas. Everything was flavorful, fresh and downright delicious. I'll definitely be back and look forward to trying the paella next time!",5,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","The Serrano ham and manchego app is delish as is the bruschetta with tomato and Burrata. The tortilla Espanola is very good. The traditional paella is very spicy and the chicken is cut up chicken breast which is a bit disappointing as was the fact that there is not actual pieces of chorizo just apparently cooked in but it is still good. The seafood paella is excellent, more traditional to Spanish versions although again a bit on the spicy side. They kept the community tables of their former location but also added tables- it's a fun location. Highly recommend the coffee also!",4,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","You should continuously bring water. What is with this place? After Happy Hour, service declines. If then. Where the heck is our water? We've asked every time and then, when I go to to the bar to ask, she wants ME to deliver the check?!?! We've ordered Happy Hour and beyond. Only because we waved someone down! You don't want us to order any more?!? Fine, I'm not interested! I just want water!",1,0
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","We came to Lola's tapas for the first time a while ago, when the weather was still nice : ) (Around April) At first I was not so sure, but then I loved the concept. Small menu, great service, fun environment. Daniel H was our server and he was outstanding. We met some good friends that we had not seen in a while (one of them from out of town) and we spent the whole evening here... Do you know how is like when you are catching up and you stay a little longer, and then the staff starts giving you 'the eye'? Well, here they did not give us 'the eye', they gave us a dessert to share! since they noticed we were catching up and we were done with our dinner, check paid and everything. Some other places don't even refill your drink and here we got a dessert? This is a place where they really know how to sets themselves apart. Way to go!",5,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","This location is a real step down from its predecessor. The first time I went it was a few days after opening. I ordered a cinnamon roll. Although warm, this pastry was rock hard and tasted as if it had been made with of garlic and then had been dipped in olive oil. The hot chocolate was adequate. When I went to the original Lola it was a hot Arizona day and I desperately needed a refreshing beverage. When you walk inside you instantly smell the delicious scent of coffee beans. I ordered a lemonade. It was lemony and tart and cold and sweet and defiantly refreshing. It was everything you could ask from a glass of lemonade and more. But the yards Lola is such a disappointment. Their lemonade tastes like a watered down, too sweet, processed minute maid beverage. It's almost impossible to compare the two.",2,0
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","The coffee is inconsistent- not necessarily bad mind you, just inconsistent. Depending on your barista it can vary from good (man with salt and pepper goatee) to terrible, strong to weak, acidic and burned tasting to decent. The seating is bizarre, and outlets are sparse. Its not a good place for a meeting, might be ok for a date. Dont buy alcohol here because their liquor license wont let you take it to the games, buy from the culinary drop out instead (confusing since they all seem connected). One more note: this place is CRAZY HOT in the summer. Really inadequate ac for phoenix. I mentioned it to a sweating waitress (who agreed) but nothing changed. I mentioned the heat to a guy who seemed to be a manager who just opened one of their cool garage doors- if anything changed it was hotter. I havent tried much of the food, mostly coffee shop pastries. The bagels are a great deal, scones were dry and muffins were nothing to write home about.",2,0
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","Love. Love. Love this place! Great service! Great environment! Great coffee, sangria and tapas! Great date place! I could go on and on. Also, the owner engages with the guests... I like when owners do this, it makes me feel important.",5,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","So far, I've only ben for breakfast, but I loved it! 1. It's at the Yard, which is really fun and a great location. 2. They have fancy coffee and tea drinks made by people who really love coffee and tea. 3. Delicious pastries, but also some healthier options like oatmeal and a quinoa bake. 4. The ambiance inside the actual restaurant is hip/industrial. Go there. Eat there. Get coffee. Drink. Hang out. You'll love it.",5,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","Just went to Lola's and had a good experience. The shrimp ($18) was enough for 2. We also had an order of the asparagus ($8) shared and we each had a glass of sangria. The sangria did have fruit . Our server, Grady, was friendly and checked on us several times. Fun, noisy place for light dinner!",4,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","I love this space, the ambiance, the long table, the bar overlooking The Yard where people drink and play in the evenings. So 5 stars for the space and coffee 4.5 stars for food. Beer could be a bit less expensive... I love coming here, but I hate the fact that most of the time you need to use valet parking.",5,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants",Service is pretty horrendous if I might say so myself. The only thing giving this a 1 star is the decor and the manager that I will talk about later in my review. Definitely Not a fan of the girl working on 5/24 at 11 being a bit to touchy feely with my boyfriend sitting next to me and calling him baby and sweetheart all night(in which he knew and plenty of other people I told about her actions knew why I would be livid). That is the reason for the 1 star mostly along with the burnt slider she probably told the chefs to burn on purpose. The fact I have to get up and help myself to my own water since she failed to ask me at one point after I finished my first glass of water if I needed anything else or different. The manager (I think) helped me more than she did and directed me to where I needed to go; since she is obviously a horrid customer service employee not noticing that if I empty out of glass and not ask if I needed anything further is a tad annoying. Asking once if I need anything isn't enough if you are a server/waiter/bartender. But apparently in her eyes it's okay to just care about the a girls boyfriend and pissing off girlfriends at this bar. The sliders were not really pleasant and i had been drinking too so you think they would be more than tolerable but good god they were so charred. Nothing I would reorder unless they didn't burn the burger so much. The bacon made the whole sliders were the only thing keeping me from not touching it completely. Will I be back? Maybe if they got rid of the bartender touchy feely lady that got me all riled up. If she is there next time i can promise you that management will be notified at that point if she starts being her inappropriate self. I'm severely tempted to write a letter of complaint to the company if they don't read these since I have never felt so disgusted in my whole entire life going to a restaurant/bar. Being Disrespected in the slightest is what i have no tolerance for what so ever and she crossed every possible line and worse by not even asking me at one point if I would like one thing after I finished my first glass of water. When i was going to pay for our tab and my boyfriend hurried so he could sneak in her undeserved tip and our balance she had no idea that we were even on the same tab since I apparently wasn't allowed to order anything for myself. I literally felt like this was some kind of joke like I should have been on one of those shows like Restaurant stakeout. *threatened by kindness and spunk to my boyfriend alone. Not to me. When you come to a restaurant you would hope for consistent service not once at the beginning. That's like getting seated at a restaurant and not getting any service afterwards. I love how people want to say that I am wrong and not making a factual speculation. Good god people. ***update it is currently 8/31/14 and no one from management has obviously reading these reviews which is a shame. Lack of concern on their part id say.***,1,0
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","Great ambiance and decor. I came here for breakfast hoping to find a good cup of coffee, something to eat and wifi to do some work on my laptop. They did not disappoint in that respect. Great cafe latte, they had wifi and my egg white omelette was edible - and I'll stop at that. The word palatable or delicious would only be used to describe the herbed potatoes (come with the omelets) if a gun was put to my head. In fairness, not much you can do with potatoes if you choose to serve them. But that's the point, don't come here for a delicious breakfast. Some people ""do breakfast"" and don't really focus on decor or ambiance; this place is about the latter, not the former. Lola apparently also just opened as the cashier and cook both responded to questions with ""I'm new here."" Why would I be talking to the cook at a restaurant you're thinking? Well, I was given a number tab by the cashier which would ordinarily cause one to believe his or her food/drink/order would be brought to him or her. Nope. After about 5 minutes the cashier brings me my latte and says, ""It's been ready for pick up at the counter."" As I look at the tab I think, ""Why did you give me this then? "" A few minutes later, the cook yells out, ""Number 2 is ready."" That's my cue I guess. The tab was apparently in case I forgot my number. When I asked the cook for a knife and fork to eat the food is when he explains ""He's New"" and has no clue. The cashier points me to the plastic knives and forks on the counter. As I walk my food to my seat, I pass a station where silverware is rolled in a napkin so I grab that and leave the plastic for the more adventurous.",4,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","food wise it would be a 2.5 - 3 at the most, but the place and the coffee made it up for the 4th star. Let me start with the food. If you've never eaten authentic Spanish dishes, you'll be pleased. Otherwise you'll be disappointed. The olives were good. The shrimp dish (gambas al pil pil) was also decent. The traditional paella was good but more a risotto than a paella. Too creamy, different kind of rice (at least the texture is different) but the saffron hint and the chorizo were tasteful. The tortilla was ok. A little burn and dry but pretty decent. The wine selection is limited and most of the wines are NOT Spanish, AYFKM? They had one Rivera del Duero and one Rioja. Come on, you have a Spanish themed place and no Spanish wine? Now the coffee. I tried the cold brew and the kopi luwak. Both pretty good. The coffee paraphernalia is also worth the visit! If you are caffeine sensitive, this might not be for you. I didn't check if in the menu they include ""cafe bombon"", a Spanish classic. I'll go back to verify that and if not, at least to get good coffee! Cheers",4,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","I am SO glad these guys are back in all their glory. They are PERFECTLY located on my way to work for coffee and I've indulged several times already. You can never go wrong with their espresso as it is nicely balanced: not too mild, not too bold. I came back the other night to try their tapas. Their filet was a delicious as I remember it. Tender and juicy with their bleu cheese butter....SO damn good. You can run up a bill pretty quickly, the filet and two glasses of wine ran over $50 but it was worth it. Not something I can do all the time, but I AM still waiting for my grade in Public Affairs research, so I hopefully will be treating myself again...soon! The atmosphere is nice enough but the fluorescent lighting from the kitchen area spills over to the rest of the venue which doesn't make for the most pleasant atmosphere. It would be nice to have a little more ambient light in the bar area, perhaps some candles. It's VERY nice space, they just need to figure out the lighting. I haven't tried their sangria yet but I hope it's like it was at the old place with the ""crack"" berries. Anyway, I'm glad they're back and I look forward to being a regular.",4,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","The location is beautiful. Everything about the decor and architecture is absolutely amazing. The service, not so much. Somewhat rude to customers about requests. Can't say that I'm a fan of the service but I would definitely try again hoping for a friendlier experience.",2,0
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","First let me say I am a fan of Spanish Tapas! Second let me say I was a HUGE fan of Lola's Tapas in the old location on Camelback. Lola's was always loud, always chaotic, always fun and always expensive. But the energy, the Spanish wine, excellent Tapas and quirky vibe was well worth it and made for a great night out! Parking = nightmare as it is every time you go to the Yard. The space is FAN-EFFING-TASTIC! All of the coffee accoutrement is exciting! We loved the atmosphere, the finishes, and the tremendous energy of all the people playing Ping-Pong, and all of the games out in the yard. However... there were only three tables with people, including us. So the vibe was off with the disparity between the two worlds. The staff was nice, not very up on the menu and a bit inconvenienced by us and/or they were so new they didn't realize that customers are a good thing? I still can't decide... After we ordered Walter came by and introduced himself. I found out a few days later he is one of the owners. I have to say I was put off by several of the things he was telling us. 1. They haven't started advertising. Explains the customer situation - almost a month after opening. 2. They are getting rid of the Spanish wines in favor of California wines. I asked "" Are you trying to make the wine more approachable?"" to which he fumbled a halfhearted yes. My instinct is that maybe Walter does not like or understand Spanish wine and does like California wine. Maybe it is just me... but if you take away the second most important thing about a Tapas bar - the Spanish wine - you can't expect to survive as a Spanish Tapas Bar for very long. I suggested he add a few more Cava to the menu - I don't think my suggestion went far based on his lack of enthusiasm as the conversation shifted to: 3. They are changing the menu and removing some of the Tapas and adding Paella. Now... I LOVE Paella. Between my friends and I we have two or three 36-48 inch Paella pans with the grills to cooks them with and a half dozen of the smaller Paella pans. Walter was kind enough to wait while I searched for an old picture of me cooking a 48 inch Paella - so it was off putting when Walter asked me what my favorite Paella was and I told him rabbit and he stood there with his mouth agape. He said they were going to have vegetable, chicken or seafood Paella. Ok. Just a suggestion but has to be REALLY good - because mediocre Paella is horrible. Not that it can't work or be a great addition, but had better be really, really good. Now to the food: We ordered the Shrimp, the Steak, the Jamon and Cheese tray and a glass of the one and only Cava. The Cava was good, ok quality = B- The Jamon and Cheese tray - had some lovely dates, Jamon was nice but cold like it just came out of the refrigerator instead of being hand sliced at room temp. The Cheese was ok and the Marcona almonds were fine = C The Steak arrived on a regular plate - not the traditional Tapas clay dish. The steak was thin, of poor quality, overcooked and luke-warm. The plate was cold and hence why the steak was not hot. The steak didn't have the cumin like at the old Lola's - instead it came with a blue cheese crumble on top, needed salt and pepper = D The Shrimp also arrived on a regular plate that wasn't heated. The first few were great, reminiscent of the old Lola's flavor and pizzazz. Then, because the plate was so cold the shrimp cooled quickly and lost their pizzazz. Started out as an A and quickly cooled/congealed to a C I sat there basking in the romantic wine soaked memories of the old Lola's - all of the chaotic energy, bumping into people, yelling over the music, laughing, spilling wine on someone and buying them a new glass as an apology, reaching for that last olive, anxiously waiving down the rushing waiters furiously trying to keep up with the second or fourth round of orders of the shrimp and wine, striking up conversation with the people next to you... With this excellent space, all of the new coffee equipment, all of the frenetic energy of the Yard Lola's Tapas should be a huge hit. I sat there willing it to be better, to match the quality of the space, the quality of the coffee equipment the quality of my memories. I truly hope they don't get rid of the Spanish wine or Tapas. I hope that they go full Spanish traditional with the clay tapas pots piping hot (just a suggestion). I hope they add more Tapas like the Croquets con Papas y Jamon, Roast Suckling Pig, Spanish honey with Manchego or Mussels with Cava and Chorizo, Fideos with Chorizo. I hope they add more Cava, and/or more... dare I say it... Spanish wine. We will give the time. The Lola's of old deserves the chance to be reborn in this amazing space.",2,0
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","This little place nestled in to The Yard is awesome!

Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","I learned about something new today. I was at the new Lola Coffee Bar at the Yard on 7th Street. They sell Kopi Luwak for $15 a cup. What is Kopi Luwak you ask? Kopi Luwak or civet coffee, refers to the seeds of coffee berries once they have been eaten and egested by the Asian palm civet. They harvest the coffee beans from the fecal matter of the civet (an asian big cat) and .... I stopped listening after hearing that and worked really hard not to laugh at Walter, the very nice and serious manager of Lola Coffee. He says its a delicacy people are willing to pay for. If you're interested he said to ask for the cat coffee. Good luck! The new Lola Coffee at the Yard is very nice. They have some cool trendy coffees and machines (cold drip coffee anyone) that look very 50's sci-fi movie. The have tapas at night and a wine bar. The decor is lovely and I look forward to making this a regular on my coffee rotation.",5,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","I haven't had the coffee yet, so can't comment on that side of Lola's. I did however enjoy their patio view of The Yard, while sipping on sangria and nibbling on tapas. Service was very good, attentive but not overly so...accomodating, prompt, fun/friendly/casual. Nice balance. Sangria was great, and tapas we had were all delish! The shrimp was fantastic! I really liked the eggplant stack, tasty enough that my eggplant hating husband even enjoyed it! The warm bread and cheesy spread were addictive. Will certainly be returning!",4,1
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","You can sufficiently judge how much a coffee shop knows its craft by the drip coffee. My 16 oz. drip coffee was the absolute worst coffee. I would rather the usual burnt Starbucks sub-par cup over what I had today. (3 packets of Sugar in the Raw, honey and cream barely masked the taste.) To begin with, it was lukewarm. Second, it was the most sour coffee I'd ever tasted. This means that they have no idea how to properly use their 3-foot drip coffee contraption. Sour coffee happens when the grounds are over-soaked/concentrated. Their filter was looking really nasty, as the entire thing was super brown from being soaked for too long. You generally want to leave a little bit of the filter untouched to know that you haven't overdone it. The coffee crumble cake was so hard, I nearly broke my fork trying to eat it. At one point, I had to hold the fork with one hand while I hit the end of the utensil with my other hand, much like a chisel and stone. I do love the decor and location of the establishment. However, I would say that this restaurant is merely imitating the coffee culture in Denver/San Francisco without actually having the credentials or ability to deliver on the same quality.",1,0
Lola's,"Coffee & Tea, Food, Tapas Bars, Restaurants","We were sad when Lola's Tapas on Camelback Road closed a couple of years ago. How exciting to see Lola's has reopened in The Yard on North 7th Street! Our party of three had no problem with reservation, parking or seating. Service was attentive and excellent. The tapas were outstanding! My favorite was the gambas (shrimp) pil-pil. We also shared a thin sliced filet mignon, chicken breast in tomato sauce, and jamon serrano with Manchego cheese. The prices were very reasonable, and the fun and games atmosphere of The Yard served as an entertaining background. I will definitely return to Lola's.",5,1

LongHorn Steakhouse,"Restaurants, Steakhouses, American (Traditional), Barbeque","A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT I HOPED YELP HAD A ZERO BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS MINUS ZERO! First of all, so many new employees made our visit difficult because they're answers to our questions conflicted each other. We were seated and waited for approximately 13 minutes before the person that seated us had to take our order for drinks because everyone else was busy and keep in mind, the place was about a 1/3 rd full (remember new employees, we know because we asked). After our drinks were finally served our waiter took our order for appetizers because our party was still deciding for our main course. After a total of 30 minutes, we had been served our drinks and appetizers only to find out when they took our final order, they were out of Prime Rib which two in our party had their hearts set on! I then approached the manager and asked, ""How can you be out of Prime Rib, it's only 7 o'clock and it's Saturday""?! He proceeded to tell me that there is a disclosure on the menu that states ""availability is subject to change"". I said well after waiting 30 minutes where they finally took our order, don't you think we should've been told that when we entered""? He then said he would look into that, are you kidding me, he didn't give a shit! After 55 minutes upon entering we were served our main course to another disappointment! My wife's $30 dollar Rib Eye was tough, my Rib eye and baked potato was cold! We sent ours back and told them to take it off my bill cause I was so done with all their bullshit!

LongHorn Steakhouse,"Restaurants, Steakhouses, American (Traditional), Barbeque","Arrived at 12:30 on Easter Sunday 2018. There was nine of us altogether, we have eaten here A few times in the past. Food is always top notch, however,We have never had exceptional service. I was a little excited when our server introduced herself and the gentleman training with her. Wow! I thought they're not busy and with two of them serving us How can we not get great service!? Sadly, I was hugely mistaken. I almost hate paying for drinks, when they're free refills but your server or helper are not around to get those refills for you. After our two appetizers were dropped off about 10 minutes later, she came to ask how the appetizer was and I told her great! We just need something to wash it down. Out of nine of us, nobody had anything left to drink. And then the concept of clearing plates/dishes was never considered. We just kept making piles in the middle the table. When the meals were dropped off my son was notified at that moment that they were out of sweet potatoes. Really! At 1 o'clock on Easter Sunday! Like, you don't know this when you put the order in a half hour ago?Never came back to check how steaks were prepared, My Mom's was supposed to be medium rare and it was medium well but it took so long to get somebody over there that we just had hers boxed up to go. Believe we saw the manager doing a couple laps around the restaurant stopping at other tables, never stopped at ours, or came over to apologize about the first well-done steak and bring my mom her second and suggest that she cut into it to make sure it's prepared correctly like we've seen other steakhouses do. I understand steaks/fillets can be hit or miss, but service should never be! Especially from the so-called management. Very disappointed. Server told us they were super busy and they were understaffed in the kitchen and in the waitstaff. There were several empty tables around us and throughout the restaurant. Poor thing, I don't know how she would handle it if they were truly ""super busy ""will not be returning. Going back next-door to Texas roadhouse!",1,0

First, the hostess seated us at a wet table. She did grab a napkin to dry it off but then, promptly left without waiting for us to sit down, hand us our menus or even tell us anything. Andrew was our waiter. He never offered us the complimentary bread & we had to ask for it. I had requested lemon in my water & had to ask twice more for the lemon. I chose a garden salad, while my husband chose a Caesar Salad: my salad was served but, we had to ask for my husband's. I ordered my filet medium rare & it was well done. Cedric, the manager that night, did bring me a second steak AND took the cost off of our tab. However, the second filet was RARE, thus undercooked. We have never had such a poor experience here & tend to think of Longhorn as better quality than some other restaurants. Greatly disappointed. Although Cedric tried to make it right, the whole dinner was terrible. I know that employee's will perform up to, or beneath, what management expects & requires. From the hostess to the server to the chef.... perhaps Cedric isn't requiring quality? ? Oh, BTW, when I mentioned that had asked for lemon in my water, the server blamed the bartender. Very sad, disappointing dinner.",4,1
LongHorn Steakhouse,"Restaurants, Steakhouses, American (Traditional), Barbeque",For being in restaurant row at Metro Center not bad at all. We waited just a few minutes for a Saturday night. The food was really good and cooked to order. The service was really good and he was on top of it. I recommend this place.,4,1
LongHorn Steakhouse,"Restaurants, Steakhouses, American (Traditional), Barbeque","1st time to a longhorn steakhouse. We went for lunch but I went ahead and had a 12oz ribeye and upgraded my side to the maple spaghetti squash. My wife did a lunch combo grilled chicken strawberry salad and french onion soup. I'll start with hers, she said I t was excellent and would get it again. We both enjoyed the warm bread. Our server was very nice and got everything quickly. My ribeye was good, not great the X server offered steak sauce and I probably should have taken it. I ordered it medium and it came perfectly done but was not as tender as most ribeye steaks I've had this was closer to a top sirloin or low end choice. The spaghetti squash lacked any flavor and for the price should be bigger and as described. If we go back I'll try the lunch combo my wife had.",3,0
LongHorn Steakhouse,"Restaurants, Steakhouses, American (Traditional), Barbeque",I hate complaining but my wife wasn't liking her steak and mine seemed thin. We mentioned this to the server and he recommended talking to the manager. The manager was very courteous and explained well why mine was thin very well. He traded my wife's steak out with great speed. The server was very nice and deserved the good tip.,5,1
LongHorn Steakhouse,"Restaurants, Steakhouses, American (Traditional), Barbeque","Lovely calm dinning room with no TV's to spoil the ambiance. Delicious food. Hubs had the rib eye which was tender and juicy. I opted for the prime rib, fantastic. Flavorful and so yummy. Great choice of sides. Try the grilled corn on the cob. We will certainly return for more. Yum.",5,1
LongHorn Steakhouse,"Restaurants, Steakhouses, American (Traditional), Barbeque","Came here the other day for my daughters 13th birthday as she asked for a huge piece of steak. We normally go to Road House next door but it was crazy packed and after a long day of work/school I made an executive decision to give LongHorn a try. Of course, after reading some yelpers reviews. We ordered our fav. the ribeye with some sides. Kiddo ordered ribeye as well. Our waiter was either tired or annoyed by us asking questions to the point he rolled his eye when walking away after I asked him how the sides worked here at LongHorn. Now, I understand LongHorn is a big chain restaurant but some of us are first timers ya know. Anywho, maybe it was just my waiter who seemed bothered by my question asking along with my pooped face from work all day mixed with his emotions and tiredness just didn't mix that day. Most likely I won't go back and will stick to our usual go to for steak RoadHouse. It just seems they always make you feel welcome there and everyone seems cheery which bumps up your mood which ultimately allows you to enjoy your dinner with those you love.",2,0
LongHorn Steakhouse,"Restaurants, Steakhouses, American (Traditional), Barbeque","I ate dinner here tonight. It exceeded my expectations. I ordered an 8 ounce sirloin steak with a lobster tail. The steak was so tender, I actually thought they brought me a filet by mistake. But the waiter assured me it was a sirloin. The lobster tail was delicious. It was perfectly cooked with very sweet succulent meat. Definitely cold water, not a cheap Caribbean lobster. Overall the food was better than I expected and I already thought LongHorn is the best of the 3 steak houses at Metro. Of course it's not on the level of Ruth's Chris or Morton's, but for the price, it was excellent.",5,1

Let me just start off by saying that this establishment is gorgeous! I really love the bar area. We sat at a high top near the bar. Zach helped us. He made me the best mule I've ever had! It was made with bourbon. We got several appetizers but the cheese stuffed mushrooms were my favorite! I was in the mood for steak and Zach recommended the outlaw ribeye. IT WAS AMAZING! And cooked to perfection. We finished our meal with a molten lava cake and banana cream pie. Also amazing. Despite such great food, my favorite part was the service. Zach was great. Very friendly, funny, knowledgeable and makes some darn good drinks! Can't wait to come back.",5,1

My bartender/server was Jimmy, very kind guy. Had some small talk ordered my usual cocktail consisting of vodka and pineapple juice. Felt a bit spontaneous and called for a green tea shot, INSTEAD I received an amazing Green Tea cocktail, holy f*** this guy is the man.

Even though this a steak place, I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken. It was so juicy and delicious. I had a loaded baked potato and mac & cheese for the sides. I'm pretty sure it was the most delicious mac & cheese I've ever had! Definitely home made. The service was excellent and the restaurant is very clean & spacious. I can't wait to go back! P.S. ~ If you leave room for desert, You won't be disappointed with the chocolate lava cake.",5,1
LongHorn Steakhouse,"Restaurants, Steakhouses, American (Traditional), Barbeque",I hate being the person that walks into a restaurant so close to closing but I took a chance and am glad I did. 40 minutes to close Megan the hostess greeted us with a very friendly smile and showed is to our table. Hayley then took amazing care of us. Making sure to tend to our needs and providing amazing service. As a first timer to Longhorn I am extremely pleased and will definitely be back as I live right down the street.,5,1

Full of smiles and assistant staff is at your call. Drinks kept full. The wait time on the food was entirely too long. Went for late lunch arriving at 2pm and only saw 2 other tables and still it took a long time. Food: Salty. It seems their favorite flavor is salt. Every single item had salt in it or on it, even the toast. Price: Not worth it! We paid $21.99 for an 8oz Filet (ordered Medium and it was cooked properly) and we had difficulty cutting it with the knife because of the gristle. We had to try it since we haven't been before.

When I asked politely if we could be seated at a regular table in the main dining room, my request was denied and we were told that the unoccupied tables were for larger parties of six or more. I mentioned that we were a party of five with a reservation to no avail. No big deal, plenty of other restaurants to go to in the future.",2,0
Lyndhurst Grill by J. Alexander's,"American (New), Restaurants",Overpriced pedestrian food. $40 for two small crab cakes and ice cold French fries. Maui ribeye was slathered in too sweet sauce.

Lyndhurst Grill by J. Alexander's,"American (New), Restaurants","I came here on a Thursday evening for a birthday celebration with my family. I made reservation for 5 which I had no problem making. The hostess sat us at our table when we got there. The atmosphere is dark but fancy like vibe to it . It was actually really nice. This is my first time here and didn't really know what to get . I started with calamari and fries for appetizers. The calamari was really delicious and so were the fries . It all came out crispy and warm. For my entree I got the rattlesnake pasta and boy am I glad I did! It had a lot of flavor it to it. I would defiantly get this dish again. My family also enjoyed their meals as well. Overall the server was friendly, the atmosphere is nice but it can get pricy !",4,1
Lyndhurst Grill by J. Alexander's,"American (New), Restaurants",Wonderful atmosphere; waitress seemed disinterested or hurried which on a Tuesday evening that was not busy is disappointing. My husband and I shared a house salad which had more cabbage in it than lettuce. I had the French dip which was awesome and Mark had a bacon cheese burger which too was good. The French fries are more like potatoes sticks but very tasty. Prices were a bit on the high side $19 for the French dip and $15 for the burger. We were overall pleased with the experience. Would recommend to friends that don't mind spending a little more for a weekday dinner.,4,1

Lyndhurst Grill by J. Alexander's,"American (New), Restaurants","This is another restaurant I visited while on vacation. I haven't been here in nearly 15 years. The menu has completely changed, probably for the better. The decor is casual with some intimacy. I think all the seating is mostly booths. Our food was excellent as well as the service. The calamari was exceptional as well as the rainbow trout. My side dish was the sauteed green beans and grilled zucchini, both good. Our bill was cheaper here than at that god awful Olive Garden. I'm still trying to figure out what we ate for $60 for two people there. I would rank them right up there with Glenwillow Grille.",4,1

Lyndhurst Grill by J. Alexander's,"American (New), Restaurants","I'm really between a 3 and a 4 on this one. My expectations were not met, but maybe there were too high. First the good. The food. That is what is most important after all I guess. I ordered the Filet Kabobs and was very pleased. Be aware the steak is served well done as a default which is rather strange, and the waitress did not prompt to ask how I wanted it cooked. So be sure you mention it if you don't want well; I chose medium and ended up quite happy. The steak is served off the skewer with large chunks of grilled vegetables (i.e., onions, green peppers, etc). That all comes served on Louisiana rice or whatever side you want. I also enjoyed the ambiance and found it very classy and comfortable. Now for the odd. I was expecting J. Alexander to behave as a higher class chain. Our waitress wasn't the best though. She would refrain from interacting with us for long periods of time even walking past the table, but not stopping by. When she did stop to check on the food - which we had begun to eat already - she asked how the food - looked - not how it tasted and then said something like it will taste even better. Just odd. At the conclusion of the meal we were never offered dessert. We asked for coffees when she cleared the dinner plates away, which would have been a logical time to offer dessert, but she did not. People love the place though, there was a lobby full of people waiting for a seat. Definitely use OpenTable if you want to eat here. I will try it again sometime. I think with a different server my rating might increase.",3,0
Lyndhurst Grill by J. Alexander's,"American (New), Restaurants",My party and I went on a Friday evening so it was quite busy. Unfortunately it still took longer than it should have for our server to take our order. I ordered the Bayou pasta dish which was delicious with a side order Alex salad that was also quite good. We all had plenty of bread with our meals and the server was quite prompt with picking up our checks. I will be returning.,4,1
Lyndhurst Grill by J. Alexander's,"American (New), Restaurants","I was very disappointed with my meal. I had the Mauhi Steak. It was supposed to be a ribeye but it looked and tasted like sirloin.

Thexe house Merlot was also good.",2,0
Lyndhurst Grill by J. Alexander's,"American (New), Restaurants","I ate here with my boyfriend and future in-laws to celebrate his cousin's graduation. I was a fan of the decor and general layout of the place. Seeing the kitchen and the chefs running around reminded me of Hell's Kitchen (sans Gordon Ramsay yelling at everyone). It was dim and had a romantic atmosphere, each table boasting a lit candle. Service was generally good as the waitstaff was attentive, though our waiter wasn't the friendliest. It was a busy evening and he was probably tired, so I can't necessarily blame him for not being talkative. I'm really fond of restaurants that give you a jug of water for your table instead of the waiter constantly refilling it with a pitcher. Our jug was shaped like an old fashioned glass milk bottle, which I found amusing. I ordered the rotisserie chicken with a side of mashed potatoes. The meat was rather tender and the broth you're given on the side really does a wonderful job at making it super juicy. I also appreciated that it wasn't fatty and dark. However, I found the skin to be rather peppery. My boyfriend got the steak (the one he got in particular escapes me), french fries, and a croissant. When I sampled each item from his plate, my feelings were mixed. The steak tasted more like a ham, the french fries were reminiscent of the frozen shoestring fries I'd bake at home, and the croissant oddly enough tasted like a doughnut. Now, I'm no expert in French cuisine but I've always imagined a croissant being more akin to a dinner roll than a breakfast pastry. Yet again, maybe I've just been eating croissants wrong my whole life. On a similar note, I also sampled his Alex's side salad. I was turned off by the amount of shredded carrots and the like and the fact that the ranch dressing was at the bottom of the salad, and I found the croutons to also taste like some sort of sweet fried dough. Yet again, I like my salads plain and covered in cheese so who am I to judge? Overall, I wasn't too terribly disappointed with J. Alexander's. I couldn't say that I was a fan of every food I tried nor the borderline obscene prices, but it's not a bad place for a special occasion. I'd come back if I had the money and the means to come back to the Lyndhurst area, but it's not on my priority list.",3,0
Lyndhurst Grill by J. Alexander's,"American (New), Restaurants",I have eaten here many times over the years and find that the food is pretty basic an ordinary in its preparation.

Fantastic!! The fries are OK... Nothing great. My wife ordered the turkey burger, which she said was great!!

Lyndhurst Grill by J. Alexander's,"American (New), Restaurants","J Alexander's is fair IMO. The service is good, the menu is pretty nice for this class of chain, the atmosphere is cozy, and the food I've experienced lately has been adequate. That said, I am one of the folks who came here back in the day when memories of a particular dish, or even side dish, prompted frequent return visits. Not so much any more, although I've heard dessert favorites like the carrot cake have endured. BTW what has two thumbs and doesn't like carrot cake... But this spot is way too out of the way to be a ""go to"" for dessert. And with a price point higher than an Applebee's, Friday's, or Carraba's, and food less impressive than your similarly priced, favorite steak, seafood or Italian spot, experienced diners, I feel, will feel short changed by the experience. Now with many options, I did pick this place to go on my birthday this year. But I think it was the nostalgia and the hope that things had changed once again...for the better. Yeahhh, no.",2,0
Lyndhurst Grill by J. Alexander's,"American (New), Restaurants","In an ironic twist, I absolutely love this place. No, J Alexander's is not one of Cleveland's hip independently-owned gems. However, the food is always flavorful and well-presented. Many would classify this as a ""fancy restaurant."" Given its low lighting, dark wooden accents, and smooth jazz tunes playing in the background, I would agree. Despite being somewhat fancy, though, the food prices are exceptionally reasonable. (I personally love coming for lunch an ordering the Hyde Park chicken sandwich, an great meal for only $11.) The bar is also nice.

Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants",I was a loyal customer and would order from this place only. About 3 months ago the quality has gone down. First it was the fried rice now it's other food. Today will be my last time ordering from them. The service is good but the food went from great to so-so. I wish it could be the way it used to be.,2,0
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","I ordered here for the first time because it was the only Chinese in my area that delivers. I was impressed how fast the food came, still very hot and fresh. Everything was good but my favorite was lo mein and kung pao chicken. Portions were good. It is the best Chinese I have had so far. I recommend this place anyone looking to tryout good Chinese food.",5,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","This place is not good !!!!!!!! not sure what the reviewers raving about this place are talking about ; we have had it 3 times in past year living nearby, today, order 2 meals, 22.50$, which is about average, comes with 1 rice for 2 meals so I ask they say well they come with smalls so we put in a large ok, I guess if that's what u wanna do for 2 adult meals, but FLAVORLESS, general gsos is soggy and gross, first time we have tried this, wife got shrimp Kung paid, no seasoning no flavor, ton of peanuts, we wanted to like this place but won't be back, F",1,0
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants",The best chinese restaurant in AZ. The egg dropped soup remind me of my mom's soup when I was a child and sick. Waitress was attentive and friendly. A guy came in an ordered a complicated meal and the staff was very friendly and accommodating! I am coming back. You guys set up the bar high.,5,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants",This is a very delicious Chinese food in this area that I could find around here and I loved some of their dishes! I was here with my family a couple times were enjoying our foods very much in our ordered for dinner when we were there! This is a true Chinese foods and the only Chinese place in this area for you and your family come to enjoy foods! I truly recommended!,5,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants",We ordered the Chicken Lo Mein and Teriyaki Chicken. The chicken was really good and not overcooked like I encounter at many places. The prices are a bit high but you get what you pay for.,4,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants",Ordered take out the other day. My fiancé liked his sesame chicken. I wish they would have packaged the sauce in its own container because by the time it was delivered the chicken was soggy. I had vegetable egg foo young. Pretty good! I also had the crab puffs. They were good too. Did not care for the sweet and sour dipping sauce. Too tomato-y for me. Service was good. The delivery guy was nice. It's pretty good and it's close to the house. I'd like to try some other things.,3,0
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","Oh my heavens was this food great! Really big portion sizes. Ordered 5 different things, it was all perfect!! I had it delivered, delivery took an hour 10 minutes. Next time I'll just order earlier. I 100% recommend this place!",5,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","My husband and I took food to go yesterday. Being from NY it's been hard finding good Chinese food! One place, not far from my house is good, but we were there so we got it. Honestly, I was a little sad that they didn't serve boneless bbq spareribs, but instead we got the bbq pork! It wasn't the same, but it was very good! We also got the Chicken and broccoli; sometimes I think twice before ordering chicken because it could be chewy! Theirs happened to be really good! For its location, in Gilbert, the prices were fair! The lady was nice, and a guy even brought it out to us when it as ready, in a box, that made it cleaner and easier to get home. I thought he was nice too! I would get food there again! It was very tasty!!",5,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","Yum!! Love this place. I've ordered something different every time and they never disappoint. Quick, hot delivery too! So glad we found this place",5,1

Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","Recently moved to Gilbert and have been trying different Chinese restaurants. We ordered shrimp fried rice, beef n broccoli and egg rolls. I would not recommend any of these items. As simple as is it to make these meals, I can't imagine the other food being any better, but can't say for certain.",1,0
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants",This review is solely based on service. Don't order online. We waited 50 minutes before calling to ask for a status only to find out they were just putting in the order and it would be another 45 minutes. I cancelled the order.,1,0
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","Sooo good! Was having Chinese food cravings and didn't feel like driving, so I looked up nearby Chinese delivery. Was pleasantly surprised--I ordered the chicken lettuce wrap and cashew nuts chicken, both which were delicious! Also, the delivery guy was very friendly and cordial. Will order from them soon!",5,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","5 stars, because they deliver! And the delivery guy, Brian, was super friendly and awesome. The food arrived hot and in a timely manner. The hot and sour soup was great with just the right amount of spice and was probably my favorite thing we ordered. Mongolian beef was good, but I'm a harsh critic on this dish, because the chinese restaurant in our old neighborhood had the best one I've ever had. I haven't dined in yet, so I can't give a rating on that, but I will try it out one of these days. In the meantime, I absolutely will be ordering delivery again in the near future. Sidenote- if you are debating between this restaurant and Great Wall chinese restaurant in the same area, go here. It is a thousand times better than Great Wall. Seriously, it beats it by a landslide. You can check my review on that one to see what I mean.",5,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","Really nice lunch place with extremely fair prices. The food came quick and the service there was very cordial and friendly. As far as Chinese restaurants go, this is a great place to grab a plate and eat quickly. The food was decent- not the best thing I have ever tasted- but for a Chinese restaurant in the middle of a desert, it was pretty good. Overall it was an enjoyable experience with enjoyable food. I would go there again!",5,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants",So far everything we have tried has been really good. Our family likes that they delivery perfect for after that long day and you don't want to cook or even leave the house. They are very accommodating on orders where the kids don't want the brocoli on the cashew chicken for instance. If you order before 3pm the lunch menu saves a few $$ . We also found out there open on holidays however the holidays the do charge a higher price.,4,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","if a lower rating was possible I would give it! Used to go here so thought we would try it again, what a mistake. This tasted so bad we threw it away, yes we spent over $31 and tossed it. Everything tasted the same, like diesel fuel, the taste would not come out of our mouth. Eat here with caution, if you dare, we wont""t be back.",1,0
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","This place is just about as good as it gets. Not only are they very nice, but the food we order is always wonderful quality. Admittedly there is a large part of the menu we haven't tried, since we stick to our own favorites, but everything we have tried is great. Plus, we feel the price is extremely reasonable for the amount of food you get. The value is especially great for their dinner and lunch combos. I love that the dinner combo comes with a crab rangoon, egg roll and a single large fried shrimp. Plus soup! All for around $10. I know of nowhere else you can get that sort of value.",5,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","This place serves up a few authentic dishes - I have ordered the salty fish and Chicken fried rice, House pan fried noodles are few times and every time they are very good.",4,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","Garbage, do not waste your money. The bo bo platter had gummy beef skewers, fried chicken skewers wsy over cooked, and mushy flattened shrimp that looked like they were beaten like an inmate. The chicken chop suey had chewy chicken, a few veggies, too much sprouts, and canned mushrooms. This slop sucks.",1,0
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I will never, ever go back here again. When they first opened their food was good but this place has gone severely downhill! They actually water down their sweet n sour sauce!!!! I have never in my life had watered down sweet n sour until we ate here tonight. The consistency was literally like red water....no joke! It was purely disgusting. We ordered crab puffs (with barely any cream cheese in them) and egg rolls and we couldn't even finish our appetizers because dipping them in the red water was just unappetizing! My husband ordered shrimp chow mein and there were 3 shrimp in the whole dish. My biggest pet peeve is when restaurants cut back on stupid things....like watering down their sauces. I have never encountered a restaurant that did that so greatly then this place. What a disgrace! If you want good quality food go to Great Wall! I wish I had, but this place was more convenient, next time I'll drive further so I don't feel that I just threw my money away!",1,0
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","I stopped in for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised by their extensive lunch menu for around $5! For $5.25 I got the chicken and broccoli, which came with soup, rice, spring roll and crab wonton. Everything was tasty and with a soda and tax/tip I walked out spending a total of $10. You can barely do that at McDonald's these days, and Mandarin Chef is much better than McD's any day of the week if you ask me. I'll be back.",4,1
Mandarin Chef,"Chinese, Restaurants","After a second visit I am revising down to 2.25 stars. They do chicken dishes pretty well but we have been disappointed in other things. And their spicy is not very spicy. I added hot oil to my spicy garlic shrimp. I actually dipped my shrimp into the side of hot oil I requested. That got 'er done. I almost requested chopsticks so that I could repeatedly jam them in my ears and stop hearing the brutal Muzak renditions of such songs as ""Yesterday"" and ""I Started a Joke"". My daughter even piped up with, ""Dad, this music is really, really bad. What is it?""",2,0
Mangiacake Ristorante & Catering,"Food, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Italian","This place was so cute. Such a nice atmosphere and interior. The food was good, simple and classic. Not too special for the area, but I would definitely visit again. I got the antipasto with two types of salads and the grilled vegetables. The small was not a lot of food but it was the right amount for the price. The coffee is really good, and so are the paninis. They messed up my boyfriend's order, he ordered a sandwich without cheese and it came with cheese, fine but could be better.",3,0

Mangiacake Ristorante & Catering,"Food, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Italian","Finally! After so many times passing by this place, I got to go Mangiacake Ristorante for lunch with a few of my former co-workers for my birthday lunch. It's a really cute little restaurant with seating in the front, and some seating in the back. I had ordered mysel the special, which I believe, was a pulled pork sandwich (unfortunately, my mind is drawing a blank, because I ate there about a month and a half ago -- this is what happens when you don't yelp right away!) Anyhow, food was great, service was absolutely awesome. The people there had helped my coworkers light up some candles and sang happy birthday to me that day (although, the candles had actually made the fire alarm go offf. Whoops!) Will definitely come back for a lunch some time soon.",5,1
Mangiacake Ristorante & Catering,"Food, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Italian","We went here randomly for breakfast but arrived a little past 11 so we missed it. But we were still out and about wiling to explore the menu. We ordered 2 coffee's and a cookie,. Service was great though. The place is kind of small. It felt very Italian even with me having overlooked that it was Italian. The cream in my coffee wouldn't mix so they changed everything for me. Everything was ok with this place and they had a decent lunch menu but we went elsewhere for lunch since we just didn't feel connected to the place.",2,0
Mangiacake Ristorante & Catering,"Food, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Italian","Ah, Mangiacake. Was that you that I heard beckoning pale little me, from across the street at lunch today? Well, here's my answer. Small, cute cafe/sandwich outfit, with a petite patio (yes, it's that small) out front. Service today was exceedingly friendly. As in, we're lonely, come and see us! Have a panini! No, come back! Pleeaassse! Which, I suppose is better than the gate keeper reception I've received at other, lesser, establishments. I found the menu to be bit busy. The lettering in the menu board, as with the tiny take away menus is really small. It's as if you should already know what you are about to order before you walk in to receive your excess greeting. Ok, ok, ok. What did I eat? Soup and half panini lunch special. I enjoyed the Woodbridge Panini and a side if a lemon basil basmati soup. The panini was neatly pressed, with a good sluce of provolone, some salami, and I think, ham. You have a choice of bread- I just guessed, and announced 'olive'. What else is available? I have no idea. Note: mini script on the menu. The soup was light and lemony, without being too tart, but was lacking the promised basmati rice. A few spare grains were tossed in, but looked lonely, swimming about the bottom of the bowl. However, for a tidy $8, I say, not bad.",3,0
Mangiacake Ristorante & Catering,"Food, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Italian","Came to this shop from a voucher deal and positive reviews at the time I saw the deal online. Came on a sunny Saturday around 1:30 pm. The place is small, casual and one of those that was converted from a Victorian house. It wasn't very busy at the time. Not sure if there's another patio in the back but we took seats in the front patio, which was small, only seat 2 pairs. But it was nice as it was under a tree and next to small flower beds and you some people watching as they come along the sidewalk on this quiet street. The daily special panini that day, which was pulled pork panini, was sold out at the time, so we just order straight from the menu. We got a steak panini and a salmon panini. Each plate came with 2 olives and a simple vinigrette salad on the side. We enjoyed our paninis. Tasty and the breads were toasted to perfection. We had our paninis with olive breads, as oppose to white or wholewheat, which I thought was a more special choice and more flavorful. The salads were also quite good. I wasn't sure if it was balsamic as I normally don't like balsamic because of the smell. But I find the smell for this one not at all repulsive. Overall, this is a nice little joint for a small casual meal. They had cakes/desserts and coffees, but we didn't get any during this visit so I can't judge those. The thing I do like most is the service. The owner Raj was an attentive and jolly fellow. He served us personally and informed us with details of their specials. He was also very apologetic for not being able to provide the daily special panini as they were sold out of the pulled pork. By the time we were ready for the bill, the owner wasn't around and the girl that attended to us was also quite friendly. We tipped 20% and will definitely come back again.",4,1
Mangiacake Ristorante & Catering,"Food, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Italian","Mangiacake funny restaurant name, growing up in up North in the Italian hood you know what this means and the mythical story to go along with it. lol Feeling like a panini in around China town? Bizarre but not really as it's at the extreme border close to the Art Gallery of Ontario. Just a block north. We split two paninis, one with chicken breast and brie the other was a turkey with tomato. Too bad they weren't grilled on the outside like one's at Cafe Supreme but the taste was alright. Nice atmosphere, cute ceiling bulbs and chandelier, wood floors, chalk written menus, restaurant is in one of the converted standard Victorian 3 story row houses so it's got character. Washrooms upstairs, main restaurant eating area in the front, kitchen in the back. Good selection of sandwiches and home cooked pasta dishes like a lasagna, and soups. Fast and friendly service. A panini and soup was perfect for a -7 degree day in Toronto. It hit the spot. :)",3,0
Mangiacake Ristorante & Catering,"Food, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Italian","Mangiacake is a great little cafe, specializing in paninis. I used to eat lunch here a lot when I was working at Mount Sinai Hospital. It's also a good place to eat if you are visiting the AGO. They have a small patio out front (on McCaul) and a bigger patio in the back. Staff are really warm and personable. They're always happy to make recommendations and kindly moved me from the patio to an indoor table when tons of bees started surrounding me once my food arrived!! (They were very apologetic about the bees!). There are tons of yummy, fresh paninis with names like ""Vespa"" and ""Woodbridge"". Portions are pretty big. You can add a salad and there are so many to choose from: chick pea salad, mushrooms, tomato/bocconcini, etc. Soups are also great in the winter. I also recommend their arangini (italian-style risotto ball, fried and served with tomato sauce -- amazing!). I don't think it is on the regular menu, but they offer it occasionally as a daily special. All in all, a great little lunch spot in a nice location!",4,1

We chose the chicken parmigiana, with which we a salad bread and all the water we could drink. The salad was okay...iceberg lettuce a little red cabbage, onion, green pepper, and tomato, choice of dressing. Then they brought out the garlic bread, wife had chosen plain bread which they didn't get her even after asking a second time. The chicken parmigiana was the brought out and I do have to say was a very large portion. The chicken was a breast which had been baked, and was not breaded, with some melted cheese on it. Both the chicken and the pasta had a thick meat sauce over them. The meat sauce was pretty bland and tasteless but the chicken was just plain terrible. I can't really describe the taste but it was dry and tuff. . I could only eat one one bite of the chicken and not much of the pasta.",2,0

It was pretty good, not as good as mine, but that's one of my specialties. I got chicken parmesan with meat sauce. The meat sauce was probably the worst I've ever had. I've seen reviews comparing it to Chef Boyardee, and I honestly think I like Chef Boyardee better. the chicken was perfectly cooked. It wasn't cooked in the style of chicken parmesan at all. I think it may have been cooked in a slow cooker, and it wasn't breaded, but it was delicious chicken nonetheless once I scraped off the meat sauce and the unrecognizable cheese. Despite the bad reviews and the terrible meat sauce, I would probably give them another try. It's the closest restaurant to my new house and they are always packed.",2,0
Milano Italian Restaurant,"Italian, Restaurants",They took my favorite off the menu. I loved their tuna sub and now its gone The interior is still the same decor. Old and dated dark. The bar is right in the dining room so it can feel overwhelmingly when there are several people there I was in the mood for spaghetti so I stopped in here. It is very close to where I live The salad was small and I'm sure it was bottled dressing The pasta was mushy. Over cooked and i had forgotten that the sauce tastes canned It is so close to home and I wish I could eat there but there is no life or caring to anything The dishes made by line cooks and no chef inspiration They have their local regulars but if you want more than chef boy r de then skip this place New Italian restaurant in town is much better,2,0

Milano Italian Restaurant,"Italian, Restaurants","The service that our group received was horrible to say the least. We were seated in an empty room and had other groups to come in after us. We had to ask our waitress for a menu. After waiting for some time for our orders, the group that came in well after us received their meals in a timely manner, mind you two different groups of people came in after us and both were served before we were. It took them two hours to bring our food out. They were short staffed and very unprofessional. Our waitress had another person to help her, but they pulled her to another table to help out the group who were seated next to us. Why? I don't know. Mind you, they received their food before us and all of their orders were correct. When our food finally came out, half of the orders were incorrect, and some didn't receive their meals at all. The person who planned the gathering had to go to the kitchen to check on her order?! Is that not ridiculous?!! We asked to speak to the manager two different times, but she never came to check on the issue. A person from our table had to get up to go look for her and overheard her say, ""I don't care"" to one of the waitresses. That was icing on the cake. We were treated like crap from the start. The manager was so unprofessional to the point where I was sick on my stomach. This family owned business is the worst. I don't want to throw the race card out but if another set of people said the same thing about the staff while in line waiting to pay for our food, then there goes your answer. We didn't mind paying for our food, what was upsetting was the lack of unprofessionalism that we received on tonight. Unbelievable.",1,0

It was even being dicussed among the employees and patrons. We were there for 3 1/2 hours. It was a horrible experience but it was my first so We still continued visiting. Two weeks ago we visited..it was a Saturday night around 7. .first.... The floor was so filthy. We were placed in ""the entertainment section""..this is what we were told. It was the same waitress!

She then follows my friend out to the car to pick a fight with her. ..all while her customers are inside the restaurant. I had to go in to tell the manager to come get her.

This place left such a bad taste in all our mouths that we literally cringed. This place doesn't resemble Italian food in the least. Maybe someone who has never eaten, cooked or even SEEN Italian food might be fooled into thinking this was edible. It's not. The chicken parm tasted like someone tossed a grilled piece of chicken (not even breaded!) in Campbells TOMATO SOUP that someone dumped canned chili in. This was not spaghetti sauce. This was flat out tomato soup (with that weird creamy orange color and no seasoning) with some crumbly lumps of undefined meat. My son got the Veal house special....let's just say...no. NO.

The margarita was extremely salty and I am not talking about the salt on the rim, when drinking it with a straw it was super salty. The blue cheese dressing that came with the salad had no blue cheese flavor. The Pollo Florentine was bland, bland bland, there was no detectable seasoning at all. The Veal Parmesan was bland as well as the sauce on top. Both of our spaghetti sides were bland whatever pasta sauce they use had no flavor other than tomato.

The house chianti was very smooth and paired well with their pasta offerings. Overall, probably not a restaurant we'd go back to.",2,0

Mirch Masala,"Restaurants, Indian, Buffets","Well, the food SMELLED good. However, upon being seated, we received two pieces of news that precipitated a rapid exit: 1) they were no longer honoring the coupons we had purchased--that prompted us to visit Mirch in the first place--because 2) they were closing in two days. Buh-bye.",1,0
Mirch Masala,"Restaurants, Indian, Buffets","I went here on the recommendation that it was really tasty, but I didn't find this to be true at all. As someone who is accustomed to Indian food from India, I was hoping for some authentic dishes. It was frustrating that all of their food seemed to have a similar spice base. In fact, their paneer sauce tasted more like tomato soup than anything else I'd had. The service was great and the location was nice, but if you have had Indian food before, don't go here. On a more positive note, their Mango Lassi was tasty (but again, not at all authentic).",2,0
Mirch Masala,"Restaurants, Indian, Buffets",Great place to grab lunch or dinner. View of the capitol too! Only gave it 4 stars though because it looks like every other Indian restaurant (Like a Banquet hall) But the food was great! Had the beef curry and rice and 5 stars on the food.,4,1
Mirch Masala,"Restaurants, Indian, Buffets","I've only eaten here for their lunch buffet, but have had that around 10 times. I've eaten at a number of Indian Restaurants around town. I think this place is very similar to most of the other places I've been. It's always consistent, service is always good, and the food has great flavor. Although a bit pricey compared to non-Indian restaurants, it's right on par with its' peers. I think lunch runs about $11 without a drink. If you like Indian food, and you're used to Americanized Indian Buffets, I think you'll enjoy you're lunch here at Mirch Masala.",4,1
Mirch Masala,"Restaurants, Indian, Buffets","Delightful food, great service. My wife and I just enjoyed some excellent late-night take-out from Mirch Masala. We stopped in to order their ""non-vegetarian dinner for two"" to go. We were in a hurry because our date night was at an end and we had to pickup our kids at a certain time. The staff at the bar were welcoming. We ordered our food - which they customized to our spice preference, medium in our case - and then shared a glass of wine at their bar while we waited. It was cozy, the music was appropriate and not too loud dirt didn't interfere with our ability to talk. We regretted not being able to stay longer to enjoy the atmosphere. Our food was ready very quickly which we appreciated and packaged extremely well. There were lots of sauces included with our meal and they survived the ride home perfectly. Even after thirty minutes in the car, the food was hot and smelled delicious. It tasted even better! Two saucy dishes (one chicken, one lamb), a huge serving of steamed rice, seasoned chicken and other ethnic treats awaited us. My wife and I were thrilled with the entire meal - every dish was different and flavorful. We were extremely pleased with Mirch Masala and are already looking forward to returning so we can enjoy their outdoor seating the next time we're hungry for good Indian food.",5,1
Mirch Masala,"Restaurants, Indian, Buffets","My wife and I ate here on Sunday night and we sat outside on the capital square, which was very pleasant. We first ordered a Mango Lassi that tasted great, so we had high expectations for the rest of the meal. We ordered the 2 person meat dish which included Chicken tikka masala, lamb curry and tandoori chicken along with naan and golubjamon(an Indian dessert) all for $40. The naan was good but the curries were terrible. They all tasted overly sweet and were a little too watery. Ive had these dishes at many other restaurants and ive never had them taste sweet before. I dont know if it was an off night for the chef or if that is how they normally taste. The tandoori chicken was even too sweet. None of the dishes had that pop of flavor that Indian/Nepali food usually has, it just tasted like sweet mush that was missing flavor. We had a lot of left to overs to take home but we gave them to some homeless people on the capital square as we walked to our car. The golubjamon wasn't good either. Needless to say, my wife and I wont go back to this establishment, I would not reccommend this restaurant for the curries, just the naan and the mango lassi.",2,0
Mirch Masala,"Restaurants, Indian, Buffets","Big fan of their buffet. Lunch buffet is 9.99 plus tax for variety of Indian food, desserts and fresh salad and fruits. The Service is really good, the owner's wife I guess, she always has smiles on her face and really friendly. The Price is decent for variety of choices. The Food is good : My favorite are butter chicken and some yummy curry beef and their fruit rice. Totally recommend for someone want to try different kinds of Indian food before they order dishes for dinner.",5,1
Mirch Masala,"Restaurants, Indian, Buffets","I liked this place before they changed their name. It is basically the same. Delicious aloo naan. Good vegetarian options. Very large menu. Always deserted at dinner time. This was my third snow-storm trip to Madison and we wanted to dine at Taste of India. This time our service was polite and attentive. Of course, we had the place to ourselves. But the server was pleasant and quick with the refills. The food: overall good flavors. Small dishes for the price, though. Our bill was about $50 for two lassi (drinks), one order of aloo naan ($2.95), and two masala dishes (lamb and vegetable). There wasn't really enough to take home from either of our dishes, and they could have been more generous with the vegetables. But the flavors were there. Overall a good place and would recommend.",4,1
Mirch Masala,"Restaurants, Indian, Buffets","Their lunch buffet is highly recommended. The selection is smaller than Maharani, but every dish is excellent. This is, by far, the best restaurant I've been to in Madison. In terms of flavor and quality, there is absolutely no comparison between Mirch Masala and Maharani. Chicken and meat are tender at Masala, and every dish has the depth of flavor. Their vegetarian curry was absolutely gorgeous. Their lunch buffet also include an excellent tofu dish.",5,1
Mirch Masala,"Restaurants, Indian, Buffets","We ordered through straight2yourdoor, so maybe that's why the food was so bad, but ... Plenty of people have figured out how to make food taste good, even after a 5 minute car ride. For 4 people getting one entree and one piece of naan, plus one $4 appetizer, our whole dinner cost $90. And it wasn't good. The dough on our momo was chewy and the naan was like trying to rip off a piece of cartilage. The curries were all watery. I was so upset I just spent $90 on that! I don't think many people in Madison have had a lot of Indian food if this was good to them ...",2,0
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","Great pho place with a nice owner! We both ordered the house special pho. The broth was warm and flavourful--a good umami with sweetness. It's a really great classic bowl of pho to warm you up and fill you up! However, I will say the flavour is on par with a lot of pho restaurants you can find around the GTA. Prices are fair and it's a great place to stop by for some hearty pho. Plus, the location is pretty great because of the array of restaurants and cafes.",4,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","The first time I came here was when they first opened. The owner helped us out with the menu and suggested I try the bun bo beef noodle. I figured might as well since that's typically what I order at any pho restaurant. First taste and I knew I needed to come back for more sooner rather than later. It was slightly different than other bun bo flavoured broths I've tried; more flavourful. It didn't taste like a soup seasoning that was pulled off a grocery store shelf. About a year later, (shame on me for not coming back sooner) I'm returning for lunch. They've come out with a pho challenge! $50, 50mins, 6lbs of noodles and meat. Finish it all by yourself and the bowl of noodles is free and you get a $100 gift card for the restaurant. This visit, I ordered the same bun bo beef noodles! The broth was a little different from my first visit; it had lost the unique flavour I thought I had picked out the first time. BUT, it's not a complaint. It was still delicious and satisfied my pho craving. The two pieces of pork hock was SO tender, fall off the bone. Didn't even know pork hock could be so tender. I also got to try my friend's satay broth. Delicious! Peanuty, slightly coconut, with a touch of sweetness. I always seem to think of Mr. Pho first when I'm craving. Will definitely be back soon. Hopefully not another year later.",5,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","Located at the end unit in the same plaza and on the same side as Yoga Tree, Mr. Pho is a small, homey restaurant serving up some delicious Vietnamese food packed with huge (spicy) flavours, and it is the Home of the 50-minute Pho Challenge of 6 lbs House Special Pho! When you are here, get ready for a pho chow down! Note: There are plenty of parking spots at the back when you drive past the restaurant. The front can get a bit chaotic at times lol. This local spot first attracted me NOT because of the Pho Challenge but for the recommendation of the Bun Bo Hue aka Vietnamese Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, and the hubby REALLY wants to come try. I'm not exactly a fan of spicy food, but the picky hubby seemed to have really enjoyed it, so it is definitely a pass :) The Vietnamese style cold coffee was also very, very good... but it certainly does takes time to make. WARNING: You may expect the coffee to come after your meal. The food IMO are delicious and very satisfying. Other than pho and vermicelli, I also love all rice dishes at a pho restaurant lol. My favourite dish at Mr. Pho is the Hainanese Chicken Rice! The flavoured rice is delicious and not oily, and the chicken is tender and juicy. I would order this again! The service from the owner is always warm, friendly and welcoming :) Definitely points right there! The owner must also be an anime/manga fanatic because of all the beautiful collector figurines displayed in the restaurant! They are not for sale (We asked lol) There are even some creative DIYs, and they look really awesome... I especially love the Goku holding up the bowl of pho lol. Overall, a good local spot to grab some pho! Challenge to finish the 6 lbs. House Special pho under 50 minutes by yourself, and it is on the house (value $50)! You will also receive a $100 Mr. Pho restaurant gift voucher for completion! Who is up for the challenge?",4,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","Came here with some friends because they were curious about the pho challenge. Upon seeing the ginormous challenge bowl sitting on their counter, we realized we were understaffed to take it on. It's massive! We opted for their pho, satay noodles, and vermicelli. All of them came in good time and all were really good. My husband got the large bowl of pho and a small would have been more than enough. The serving sizes are pretty big. I got the vermicelli and the spring roll that came with it was really delicious; super crunchy with a pretty good filling. Our friends that got the satay noodles were also happy with their food. I was surprised to see it come out bright yellow, since I'm used to seeing reddish satay noodles, but the flavours were really good. Our waters were constantly refilled the owner served us. He was happy to talk to us about his eclectic collection of Funko Pops and Gundams that line his walks and his travels to Japan. He just seemed genuinely nice and happy to talk to people about just about anything. You don't usually see that in these kinds of restaurants.",5,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","The satay beef soup noodle tasted spicy !! First sip of the soup made me cough because my throat was burning. When I continued to take in the second sip, the third and the fourth and on....: I could taste the different flavours in the soup. Other than satay, I tasted the sweetness of the broth and as well as the peanuts . Also I was getting used to the spicy flavour. I couldn't stop eating though my lips were burning and were swelling a little bit. I could finish the whole bowl with just the plain noodles or even just the soup. At the end of it, I drank all the soup in the bowl of noodle. It tasted awesome! Next time, I would want to come back for the Hainanese Chicken with Rice. Besides food, the owner is also exhibiting his collection of Gundum models around the restaurant. He's happy to answer any questions about his Gundum models or just simply chat with you.",4,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants",Amazing food! You have to check this place out!! The broth is all home made with no MSG! We got the pho and it was delicious!! Prices are very affordable and the portions are huge! I found my new favourite pho place! Will def be going back :),5,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","more of a 3.5 but bump up for great service. - curry and roti 4.75 - not bad portion size, crispy roti, and I liked the curry as it was full of coconut flavour. - house special pho regular size - bigger than average portion, broth was subtle but flavourful - Small restaurant but decent amount of seating. There was only a few tables occupied when we went. - Average price compared to the other pho restaurants - friendly service that gave off a homey atmosphere - Not a bad pho place... but there are better in the area",4,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants",Food isn't the greatest. There are definitely many other pho places for flavour. Spring rolls have fresh bean sprout in them that are not cooked.. not sure if that's okay to eat.. but definitely did not taste good (way too much bean sprout that over powered the taste overall). Service was relatively quick and good. Very polite and efficient. I really enjoyed the interior decor of the figurines along the walls. Definitely a unique touch up. All in all.. I won't recommend this place for flavour.,1,0
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","Mr Pho deserves the name Mr.Pho. This place is a gem and I'm so mad about not knowing about this place earlier. I was craving pho so my boyfriend looked up places to go and Mr.Pho was close and had good reviews so we just went for it. The place was bit hard to find in the winter evening. I'm not familiar with the plaza itself so my boyfriend and I were like staring down each store to read the name (noobs). But the Mr.Pho is located in the corner right next to the extended parking lot section. The owner even set up his own flashing lights to light up the place in the dark! It's a small pho place, seats about 10 tables. We came in around 6:30 on a friday and there was one other person eating. Seated and greeted immediately. We ordered the rice paper pork spring rolls, rare beef with tendon pho, and my boyfriend tried the satay beef in a spicy soup. The portions of everything is massive! Which I was really surprised about. I know pho tends to be in a big bowl but the size here really outdid itself! The regular was like a large in other places! I got the regular and my boyfriend got the large. The large was just something else. even the spring rolls were huge! I expected the regular size ones all the other pho places give. No, these spring rolls were huge I had to use two hands to hold it to avoid any spillage! The spring rolls were packed full of stuff and it did not lack in the meat portion, everything was just right. If you like spicy definitely try the Satay Beef it's a specialty there and the owner was raving about it. The owner himself was wonderful. He speaks perfect English and Chinese and he is willing to accommodate you in any way. You can tell he really cares about the food and wants his customers to be happy! If something says there are peanuts in it, he said he can remove it for you if you let them know ahead! He came back to fill water several times which is rare to find in a lot of restaurants nowadays (I don't know why). Even when he brought our food out he would help rearrange our table to put the food down and avoid any spillage onto our stuff. He was so considerate and sweet.",5,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","Came here because it just newly opened and I was surprisingly not disappointed. Lots of pho places in Richmondhill/Markham are less than average. Coming originally from North York where there are a bunch Vietnamese owned Pho places, I do know what a good bowl of pho taste. I didn't have the common beef rice noodle (since I'm accustomed to my mother's), but I had their grilled chicken w/rice, spring rolls and their special Thai rice noodle soup. Their large size for noodles are huge and very generous with toppings and noodles. It was only $11 and it can honestly feed two people. The taste was very flavourful, meat was tender and noodles were of good quality. My rice didn't look appealing at first, but honestly, the spring roll and chicken that came with was pretty good so I'm not complaining. I can tell that the chef makes sure that each dish will be flavourful. Will be back to try other items on the menu! The one star less is because for the price of the rice dish, you would get a steamed egg or shrimp cane or shredded pork along with it.",4,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","Was gonna try this place out for the first time, but was politely turned away tonight because the pipe in their washroom bursted or something, the owner worried he cannot provide a pleasant environment for dinner because it ""might"" smell. I didn't smell anything from where I was standing (almost in the middle of the restaurant), but I did appreciate this level of care and will return in the future to try out their food.",5,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","So I came back to this restaurant several times after my initial review and have now bumped it from a 4 star to 2 star. Reason? Well.. I've had the bun bo hue twice and the thai style house special beef noodle soup twice and I have realized that these soups are a hit or miss! I've had one great experience with each..then the next the soup will be extremely spicy or extremely oily... I also ordered the roti & curry sauce and it was extremely pathetic. The roti was two paper-thin pieces of (probably) frozen and purchased at T&T roti... it was very bland and...SMALL. The curry was even sadder... it was in the size of those soy sauce/ketchup dishes.. and it was really, really salty. For just over $5 I expected something half decent.. or maybe at least a bigger (less concentrated) portion of curry sauce? I think I've tried this place enough for a fair review and sadly will not be returning.",2,0
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","When they first opened, the portions were huge. Lots of beef, noodles, and soup. Because of this, my boyfriend and I decided to share a large pho with wings and spring rolls. All the noodles and meat fit in the two side bowls after one serving, so we decided to get the XL instead the following week. Even with the XL - it was just a huge bowl with lots of soup and everything fit into the same 2 side bowls yet again. That was very disappointing. This is run by Chinese - not Viet - but they make it pretty well. The soup is good and doesn't make you feel thirsty afterwards. The fried spring rolls aren't the typical ones from the viet restaurants- they use a different wrapping? The owner is really nice... however sort of defensive. I took a sip of my viet iced milk coffee and told my boyfriend it didn't taste right (it came in that drip coffee and everything). Then the owner heard me and came over and asked if I wanted one remade which was nice, but starts explaining that the reason might be because the coffee might have had too much water? I wanted to tell him that it's because I don't taste the condense milk- it tasted like it was mixed with milk and sugar but I didn't get a chance to speak, and I didn't want another coffee. He gave us 10% off. This place gets the job done if you can't find anywhere else but it's not ""authentic"" and there's definitely way more soup than noodles and beef.",3,0
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","We had their pho, and the soup base was watery and tasteless. Upon telling staff about how their soup lacked flavour - (saying it very nicely, not expecting anything in return, only to tell them what they are serving their customers), they started attacking us, telling us a lacklustre excuse of if we had come 30 minutes later, the soup would taste better if it was boiled longer. Essentially, they told us that it was our fault for not coming at a suitable time to have their soup at a good state. The lady there continued to say ""some people like it bland and some like it salty, I can't just add salt to the whole pot"". She completely missed the point, IT WAS THE SOUP ITSELF, THE FLAVOUR OF THE BEEF, NOT THE SALTINESS. I would give this place 0 stars if i could. They were arguing back to us. Completely unprofessional and so rude. If your dish is not up to par, DON'T TAKE ORDERS AND PUT OUT FOOD. It is not up to the customer to just come at the perfect moment to have what they expect. Do I have to call them up and ask beforehand if their soup is good? This is a restaurant, you are supposed to be prepared for the dinner rush! Terrible service. Their response to us was absolutely disgusting and appalling. Telling all my friends and family to never go here. If you are reading this. DO NOT GO!",1,0
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","This restaurant just opened recently and I think they are relying heavily on word of mouth advertising so thought I would write them a review after my first visit which was enjoyable. I came to try the satay beef noodle which was really good! I am usually disappointed by the satay beef noodle at most Pho places, but this broth was the perfect intensity and had slight coconut milk and peanut flavour which was not too overpowering. The beef was also quite tender. The owner was really friendly and asked for my feedback on the food, and he even gave me a candy that he said was good to cleanse my palate after having the satay soup. Will come back to try their other dishes.",4,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","As the restaurant that we had intended to go to was closed for the day, my lunch posse wound up here. With a name like Mr. Pho, the was only one choice. Our table ended up with two house specials, a satay pho, and a vermicelli bowl. As my pho arrived, I ate with my eyes and was looking forward (pun entirely intended) to diving in. But as the first taste of soup hit my lips, I was immediately disappointed. Lacking in complexity and flavour, I would best describe the soup as single dimensional; the addition of sriracha and hoisin bringing it to two. The texture of the noodles was ""just done"" with some obvious bite to it, but not enough to be unpleasurable. Yet credit must be given where credit is due, and so my compliments on the tripe and tendon which were cooked with authority, yielding easily with every bite. With the smattering of positive reviews, coupled with my experience herein described, and with the plethora of alternatives in the area, I have yet to decide if I will return.",2,0
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","One of the best phos I've ever had! SIL and I went here for late lunch and decided to order one pad thai and a large house special beef pho to share.The server (or maybe he's the owner?) was nice enough to inform us that they serve big portions. He said it might be too much food for us so he suggested we get a regular size pho instead and if we still want more he will just give us additional pho for free. True enough, we were so full in the end we couldn't eat anymore even if we wanted to. We really appreciate the guy's honesty. Aside from that, their service was quick and place is clean. We'll be back for the large pho!",4,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants",The broth was so good. U can tell the owner made it in the store...So fresh.. very clean. And the portion is quite big and the price is comparable to others...But the broth is the best,5,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","Just moved in around the area and was looking for my go to pho place and i think i found it! The place is rather small but other than that, great experience! Large portions, prefect soup, very kind, friendly and fast service! Would highly recommend :)",4,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","Don't let the location fool you. It doesn't look like much but this restaurant has the cleanest kitchen, this small PHO place is a gem on HWY 7 and the most delicious Beef Bone Soup base ever tasted the food is next to die for just like being back home in Vietnam...Located at 360 Hwy 7. This is one of Ontario best kept secrets.",5,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","I had no clue this place opened until I found it on Yelp. I was just at this same location a few weeks ago for papa chang. The layout and decor is basically the same, wooden decor with a tv in the back. I would estimate the place can have max 35 people. The menu seems to lean a bit more towards Vietnamese food with a fusion twist of Chinese. I can't say it's the most authentic I had, but it's tasty in its own way. There are the traditional pho dishes, which was lacking a bit in flavor. It was missing that star anise flavor. There are also a variety of appetizers, fried rice, vermicelli to name a few. We tried the roti and it was quite tasty. A bit oily, but generally light and flaky, with a bit of curry and pickled veggies. While the pho seemed to lack a bit of flavor, it was still very decent, portion size was also very generous and they didn't skimp on the meat. It was very satisfying over all. My other half got a satay curry based soup, which had a nice after taste of coconut. The service and people were very friendly, welcoming and chatty. Food came out quick and hot, decently tasty with good portion sizes, and a fair price (starts at $8.50). Tough to fault a place that is fairly priced, decently tasty with generous portions. This place is a welcome addition to the local noodle scene. Only negative is its in the very back corner of the plaza. From hwy 7 you would see yoga tree and a hot pot place before seeing this place. Definitely worth a try, can't really go wrong overall",4,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","Very tasty. Great service. Fresh food. I would say that although the owners are Chinese they do a great job. Portions are very large. I would say that it's the best in this area. I love the Pho, rolls and the roast lemongrass pork with vermicelli.",4,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","Finally to try this ""Sound Hot"" Pho, hahaha! The server is funny, he understands what customers want and also made my parents laugh;) I ordered their Satay style and hear it cook with bone soup, my parents ordered Pad Thai is BIG ITEM for share! Happy Friday guys",5,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants",It was amazingly BAD! I dunno if the owner ever had pho or viet food before but they should do a research before starting a business.,1,0
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","I'm not Vietnamese so I don't know what's authentic or not, but what I had was pretty darn tasty and the serving was very generous. The small is probably equivalent to a large elsewhere IMO however price wise, it's also closer to a large elsewhere. Our table of 3 decided to try 3 different types of soup base - Original, Thai style and Satay. They were all very good. My favourite could possibly be the Thai style. It's a tom yum type soup base and it yummy with pho noodles. No extra hoisin and sriracha sauce required. Service was great too. The waiter (possibly the owner) was checking on us often to make sure everything is up to par. The basil leaves and bean sprouts were so fresh too. I'll be back for sure because I've been eyeing the bowl of vermicelli at the table next to us.",5,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","I was debating between a 3 or 4 stars review, it might be closer to a 3.5 - it has decent and savoury pho to satisfy my cravings with friendly service. For 3 people, we ordered a large pho, a chicken vermicelli (Mong) and chicken wings. We were warned that the large pho is huge, and no kidding... it was HUGE, they're very generous with the portions even the beef (which usually gets skimped). The beef broth is not light and comes in a darker tone. I liked it but for my mom, she thought it was kind of heavy and a bit salty - so it's personal preference? The noodles were chewy, and the beef was good. They know how to make a good pho! Although the menu has 'set' pho combinations, the waiter told us to let him know of the desired combination and it can be done. No extra charge! The chicken vermicelli came with a spring roll which was extremely crispy! Again, the portion was really generous, almost spilling out of the bowl it come in. The chicken wings were standard fried wings, but no flavouring... when it was supposed to be Vietnamese style wings. It came in a basket of 5wings for $6.25 which I do not think it's worth... All and all, would I come back? Yes, since I always have a pho craving!",4,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","I came here with my family during lunch time and there were quite a few tables occupied. We were nicely greeted by the manager of the restaurant who really knew how to joke/make my parents happy. Portion sizes here are quite big and the prices are reasonable. My dad ordered the Pho which he said the soup was flavourful, and the noodles were good. However, he said the beef was not tender. My brother-in-law got the House Special Pho which comes with way more beef and other cuts and he really liked it. I shared the Chicken and Pork with Rice and the Vermicelli with Pork. The flavours were actually quite decent/satisfactory, but I thought the presentation of both dishes was lacking (not enough pickled carrots, cucumbers, etc). I also found that the Chicken+Pork in the rice dish was TOO salty (and it kinda had that ""glaze""/oily colour on it, kinda like that colour you get when you go korean BBQ and you haven't changed the grill in awhile, you know what I mean?!). The vermicelli with pork had plenty of meat and noodles, but I felt it was lacking some veggies. I also didn't like the wrapper the spring rolls were made with; they used the ""smooth"" kind that you find in Dim Sum Spring rolls (instead of the bumpy ones that I normally see at Vietnamese restaurants), although the filling was more traditional. Overall, portions were big, price was reasonable, my family loved it -- but I feel I've had better and more authentic Vietnamese food elsewhere.",3,0
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","Food is delicious, ordered the satay beef noodles, meat portions are plenty and the broth is rich with aroma. Spiciness of the soup is just right. My girl ordered the hainanese chicken rice, chicken is soft and tender and rice is infused with chicken flavour. Excellent service by the wait staff and food came quickly, definitely coming back again!",4,1
Mr Pho,"Vietnamese, Restaurants","This review is based on my lunch experience at this new Vietnamese restaurant which opened up last week. It's a quaint little restaurant nestled at the end of a strip plaza which has plentiful parking. Simple decor is what you first notice when you enter the restaurant. Then the delicious smell of the beef broth simmering in the kitchen hits your senses and you know this place is serves the real deal. Confirmation comes when my pho is served piping hot and packed with flavour. I was quite impressed with the generous amount of meat and the fresh noodles they used. I ordered their Vietnamese drop coffee over ice AND they threw in complimentary chicken wings that were enormous! Fully satisfied at this point, I ordered their Hainanese chicken rice to go and I enjoyed that for dinner. The portions are huge and good is priced right. Good food is important, however service cannot be overlooked!!! The owners of this restaurant are friendly (can be humourous at times); which made my visit memorable. I will definitely be returning!!!",5,1

I'm a huge fried chicken but Nando's has made me fall equally in love with grilled chicken because it tastes so great here. The chicken sandwich is highly underrated, I don't see many people get the sandwich but it tastes great (especially with their sauces) and the chicken is juicy and tender. My other favourites are the 1/4 chicken and 1/2 chicken (extra hot) and I can always count on those to hit the spot. They also have a great variety of sides, my favourites being the corn and peri-peri fries. Can never go wrong with a cheeky Nando's.",5,1
Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken,"South African, African, Barbeque, Chicken Wings, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Portuguese",Delicious delicious chicken. I cant get enough of their piri piri sauce. Although pretty expensive as compared to the grocery store rotisserie chicken that you can buy for half the price it is a nice treat every now and then if you are getting tired of the same old chicken. The sides are meh. The chicken is the ckear star. I wouldn't go too often but on days I am too tired to cook we will be walking over to Nando's.,4,1
Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken,"South African, African, Barbeque, Chicken Wings, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Portuguese","Even though I have been to the Home Sense and Marshalls close to this Nando's for so many times, I missed this nice Portuguese peri-peri Chicken place since it's open. What a pity! The staff here are very friendly and explain how the order process works to me since I guess I'm looking so confused. If you choose to dine in, grab a seat first, go through the menu, go to the cashier counter to place and pay the order. Then all you have to do is wait until the server brings your food. Yep, like this simple. My problem is how much tips do I have to pay......Next time I'd better choose to order take-out. Then this won't bother me anymore lol We choose a half chicken with Mango Lime sauce, plus salad and potato wedges as sides. The portion is great for two girls. There are various sauce options. Nice to try. My favourite is the garlic one.",4,1

Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken,"South African, African, Barbeque, Chicken Wings, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Portuguese","Nandos, everyone should experience this ""restaurant"" at least once( quotes because it's a little different from traditional restaurants, just go you'll see what I mean) chicken is full of flavour. nandos has a great peri-peri sauce, not over seasoned like other places that offer similar food. Garlic bread is also rather impressive, I know you're probably thinking it's hard to get that wrong, but you'd be surprised. If you're hungry, I recommend the half chicken with mashed potatoes. The mash is not overly salty and has a pretty even consistency. 4 stars because they changed the rice a few years back and I still haven't gotten over it.",4,1
Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken,"South African, African, Barbeque, Chicken Wings, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Portuguese",I totally dis-agree w/ some people w/ a poor review. Been going here ever since and the service and food is perfect compared in Nandos downtown. Here in Eglington location they serve the best tender-juicy grilled chicken ever! Service crew give you a warm welcome smile and they are really good on what they do. More importantly is the food- the food here is grilled and serve fresh and hot. Keep the good vibe Nandos Eglington.,5,1
Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken,"South African, African, Barbeque, Chicken Wings, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Portuguese","The food here wasn't good at all. The meat was done right, but it just tasted like there was no flavouring. Even the flavoured rice tasted like plastic. There was about 3 veggie options, but they were mainly just wraps and sandwiches. The service was quick, we got all our food for 6 people in less than 10 minutes. The sauces they provide is okay, but not very flavourful and mainly tasted like hot sauce.",2,0

The manager tried to cover up for it later by offering free coupons but my appetite was gone by then. Go to any other location but not this one.",1,0
Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken,"South African, African, Barbeque, Chicken Wings, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Portuguese","I've been here both with a big group and just me and my hubby and there seems to be a difference in the quality of the chicken between the two. With a big group we always get the 1/4 chicken (leg and thigh) lemon herb with the Portuguese garlic bread, Casa salad with oil and vinegar and spiced rice. We order and pay at the cashier then they deliver the food to our table. The chicken has always been hot, juicy and flavorful while the sides complemented the chicken well in taste and freshness. Eating here with my hubby we ordered the 1/2 chicken (which was actually two 1/4 chickens) with lemon herb which was a little on the dry side but still tasty. For the sides we had the appetizer platter with the roasted red pepper dip which came with pita, 3 grilled wings (tender and juicy) and the Portuguese garlic bread. The red pepper dip was salty but the garlic bread which was grilled was delicious. The bread was even better when dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. TIPS: Come with a large group If you come with a small group order the 1/4 chicken (leg and thigh) or wings to make sure your chicken is not dried out. For sides, get the grilled Portuguese garlic bread (make sure to dip it in some oil and vinegar), Casa salad with oil and vinegar and spiced rice.",4,1

I know this caused it because this is the only change I made to my diet within the last few days.

Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken,"South African, African, Barbeque, Chicken Wings, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Portuguese","Went today with my boyfriend as we were trying to look for something a little healthier than the usual fast food options. It was my first time there but the cashier was very helpful whenever we asked questions. We settled on sharing 10 of the grilled wings with a side of corn and rice which all came to about $21. Food was very tasty and I really liked how you get the whole wing and not just the little halves. Also really enjoyed that our corn was still on the cob. I was very full after, even though we shared. The girl (different from the cashier) who brought our food said she'd return with our waters in a moment, but never came back. And you NEED water when you're having spicy food ! I had to go the counter and ask and said it slipped her mind, but there was no one else in the restaurant ... It happens. But still. Anyways. Good portions for a reasonable price for 2 people eating food that doesn't taste processed",4,1

Even though the taste of the product is sub-par to what im used to in africa. Still amazing, but a little on the pricey side. There are plenty more Portuguese bbq joints in town with at par flavour and more authentic side orders. Nando's has become very commercial and has lost some of its authenticity.",3,0
Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken,"South African, African, Barbeque, Chicken Wings, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Portuguese","I've been to this Nando's location plenty of times and service fluctuates a lot, so does the food quality. It is pricey for what you get and I usually get the chicken breast/wing combo with one side. Sometimes, if I feel like it, I'll get the chicken livers (just the app).. it's seriously so good. Get the garlic ""heat"" and it's great. The food is good. I've only had one bad incident where I ordered my usual 1/4 chicken breast/wing combo and everyone at my table was served while I was waiting for my plate. After 5 minutes, I went up and asked and they said ""oh, we missed your order, we'll make it right away"". So I waited, very hungry at this point. My friends didn't want to start without me. When I finally got my plate, I hungrily ate everything quickly. Then I noticed they gave me 1/4 chicken (leg and thigh combo). By that time, I had already all everything so I couldn't argue. I went up and told them they delayed my order and messed it up. They didn't even apologize! Anyway, I would suggest going to Churasso Villa just a couple blocks away! I heard it's really good. Next time, I guess. P.S. You pay first and have to include the tip beforehand.. so the process is a bit backwards.",3,0

Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken,"South African, African, Barbeque, Chicken Wings, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Portuguese","Been to Nando's quite a few times. Everytime I get a hankering for some South African food (nostalgic) I drop by this Nando's location. And ever time, the service is slow. But it's really all about the chicken. And if you don't get hot or extra hot, I wouldn't hold it against you. I prefer mild (lemon garlic) since I like to taste what I'm eating without having to hose my mouth down. My favourite dish is the chicken liver with a Portuguese bun. Try it, you won't be disappointed. General observations: Order and pay at the counter. No biggie I suppose, but I always find it odd when the credit card machine asks how much tip you want to add, when they've actually haven't done anything for you yet. You'll get a number which you can then take to your table and after a little patience, they'll find you and bring you your order. Good food once you actually get it!",3,0
Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken,"South African, African, Barbeque, Chicken Wings, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Portuguese","I love Nando's . The chicken is juicy, everything is spicy, the side plates are delicious and the prices are reasonable. I ordered a half chicken with salad and rice and covered everything with their garlic sauce. The selection of sauces is excellent, they have a very unique peri-peri taste. Definitely worth checking out for fans of carribean, Mediterranean and other regions of the world that employ alot of spices. Beware of the extra-hot sauce!",5,1

Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken,"South African, African, Barbeque, Chicken Wings, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Portuguese","Every time I get food here (usually about once a week), it's always the Fiesta Meal. Chicken breast, rice, salad (chopped Romaine lettuce and diced tomatoes) and it comes with a light spring dressing and sour cream for the chicken and rice. I usually get the spice level hot but G prefers his a combination of medium/hot. Like one reviewer mentioned, it does continue to burn after. :) It's kind of interesting to note that they get you to pay for the meal before you sit down with your number at a table and there's an option to tip on the machine (if you're paying by any kind of card). Not quite sure why they have it set up this way... how do I know what I'm going to tip if they haven't served me the food yet?? All of that being said, their service is decent so I don't have issues leaving a pre-tip. (Oh, but on that note, why the heck is tip calculated as a percentage of the meal??? In my books, service is service, regardless of how expensive the meal is. I wish the practice of tipping with set dollar amounts would take hold vs a percentage of the meal. Would you tip a valet more or less depending on the venue or the cost of your meal? Ridiculous.) But I digress, the food at Nando's is good, the dining experience: casual and the spice levels: hot, hot, hot!",4,1

It's located just across the Nellis Air Force Base and is definitely a hole in the wall. Tiny parking lot, right next to an old/worn down auto body shop, kind of isolated, but don't let that scare you away. We had the Tom yum soup with chicken, yellow curry with chicken, and chicken fried rice. The Tom yum soup was perfect and the chicken fried rice was flavorful that came in a large serving size. The yellow curry was the highlight of my meal. Oozing with flavor, chicken tender to perfection, and the flavor was so rich that my sister and I devoured this dish first. We wanted to try more items on the menu so we will surely be back. The inside is pretty small with a few tables & the aesthetic is super cute and welcoming. The best part though are the cheap, affordable prices. They also have lunch specials so make sure to check those out. I'll absolutely be back here whenever I'm in town.",5,1

I haven't had pad Thai that I enjoyed, truly enjoyed in a very long time.. it's either too this or too that or not enough this or that.. but this pad Thai was AWESOME!! My husband had the shrimp/chicken fried rice and it was just mouth watering . Our friend had the Thai beef salad and also was delicious!!

All in all the food is amazing and well located near Nellis. My one critique is they should layout the restaurant with 2-person tables and they could fit more people in for lunch. They need additional help during the busy lunch hour when the wait drags on for 45 minutes to an hour. But the chef is cooking up some really good Thai food.",5,1
Narong's Thai Kitchen,"Fast Food, Restaurants, Thai","I don't remember who introduced us to this nearly legitimate hole-in-the-wall (as it's adjacent to an.. autobody shop? a car wash? I don't even know...) but I need to find them and thank them profusely. This place is the best and most authentic Thai food in North Las Vegas or away from The Strip that I have found so far. We had Thai visitors with us and took them here, and if they called it authentic, I'll take their word for it. Now on to the food. I'm going to skip past the Pad Thai, Fried Rice, and Thai Iced Tea, because 1) we all know it's delicious and 2) they do it just as delicious. Some of my personal favorites: Fried Pork Belly & Rice: Simple dish, exactly as it sounds, with a few dipping options but honestly it's pretty damn good 'au naturel!' The pork belly is a really balanced mix of meat with the richness of the fat of that area, so don't think of bacon or pulled pork - this is unique in itself and SO good. It has a perfect combination of thick crunch, chew (both meaty and fatty), and the melty-in-your-mouth richness that animal fat does. Couple that with rice as your level base, and you've got a pretty darn good meal right there. Mango Sticky Rice: Anyone that hasn't tried this yet needs to go find some, NOW. This is a uniquely Asian dish (to my knowledge), using short grain rice, soaked overnight (the actual process escapes me), steamed, sweetened with coconut milk or something.. and then you add ripe mango with that and sweet milk (condensed milk? coconut milk? sorry guys, culinary fail today) but regardless, the tangy sweetness of the fruit with the bulk and chew and more subtle and level sweetness of the rice - it's really divine. Oh, and the rice really is quite sticky; don't try to cut through this with cheap plastic cutlery - it's not going to work. Give these guys a try. The staff, food, and service are authentic to Thai values, and I'm just beyond glad they are within such a close proximity to work.",5,1

They get seated before me after I waited for 10 minutes. The server acknowledges me and ask me if I want a water while I wait. I'm annoyed but thankful that he asked if I needed anything while waiting. I tell him I'm good and I'll wait, thank you. After 16 more minutes of waiting they seated another group before me. The server came up to me at this point because I'm sure he could tell I'm furious and he said it'll be just awhile longer...I told him I'm good and left. I'm so disappointed with this place I understand it's more money to seat a group with four people versus just seating one individual but come on twice in a row. : Update: 2-20-18 I'm updating my review after I went in today for a pickup.

Narong's Thai Kitchen,"Fast Food, Restaurants, Thai","The best hole in a wall I've found in North Las Vegas. This Thai restaurant was good and I'm glad that I didn't judge a book by its cover this time lol. It's not located in the safest area of Craig Road, but it's right across from the military housing if that makes you feel better lol. Parking is small but you can park in front of the restaurant closer to the car wash. When you walk in the place is surprisingly clean and cozy with modern decor. The menu is extensive, they have a lot of good choices. We ordered -combo pad see eu -chicken pad Thai -thai tea -garlic rice -beef jerky -chicken satay Everything was delicious! The Thai tea was the best, made nicely and not too sweet for my taste. For apps we had the garlic rice, beef jerky, and chicken satay. I would come here just to order the garlic rice, it's my favorite thing ever and I could eat a whole bowl of it (no raaaagrets). Also doesn't hurt that it's just as good as Nittaya's garlic rice except for half of the price ($3.95 for a bowl at Narong's). I enjoyed the beef jerky it was chewy (not in a bad way) and flavorful. I didn't have a lot of the chicken satay but my friends said it was good. They use a chunky dipping sauce for it here, and the cucumber salad it comes with is refreshing. For entrees we shared the pad thai and pad see eu. They were both good! I usually never order pad see eu because it is too sweet of an entree for me, but theirs was not that sweet. I liked the way the cooked their noodles too. The pad thai was good I got a level 4/10 and it had a good kick to it. We were too full for dessert but next time I'll make sure to have room.

The service was very quick, we ordered our food and within less than 10 minutes they had our orders hot and ready. I ordered the chicken pad Thai, it had a bit of sweetness that was balanced out with savory chicken. There was enough food for me to get full at lunch and save half of it for lunch the next day.

I have asked for a couple entrees to be made without fish sauce so they can be vegan and everything so far has been very tasty, unfortunately the Pad Thai cannot but there is a ton of other great options. This spot is not in the most beautiful area but the interior is very modern in design and it's cute little place. Customer service is consistently phenomenal and the prices are great!",5,1
Narong's Thai Kitchen,"Fast Food, Restaurants, Thai","Finally a decent asian restaurant close to Nellis AFB. If you drive by the area, you would never guess that this place exist. I love everything that we ordered and the food was not pricey at all. They give military discounts as well so Im all about that lol. the service was excellent and will be my new go to spot my ratings: 5/5 beef stew soup 5/5 papaya salad 5/5 chicken fried rice 5/5 calamari 5/5 thai tea yummmy",5,1
Narong's Thai Kitchen,"Fast Food, Restaurants, Thai","One of the best thai place in North Las Vegas. We were browsing yelp and saw that they just opened up. Went to order a bunch of food from yelp 24 and our food was ready in 20 mins. Upon arrival to the restaurant, we noticed that we forgot to order some dessert so we added two boba tea. They were so nice to give it to us for free since we ordered a lot. Servings are pretty huge. Come here hungry or just come and have a lot of leftovers for the next few days. My personal favorite is the duck curry - Authentic taste and very delicious. The staff are very friendly and they make you feel comfortable like you are in your home eating your mom's cooking. They asked us where we're from, where we live and we told them that we live on base which basically is across the street. They said that they will deliver up to the gate (since they can't come in on base) and that makes it easier and faster to get food. Just call them and tell them to deliver your food in front of the gate and they'll be more than happy to deliver it to you warm and fresh. This will definitely be our hang out / late night craving, getting sober spot.! Highly recommended.",5,1

I came with a group of 6 and we're damn near reseated three times. When we walked in, the lady at the booth told us we could sit anywhere. Once we're seated a gentleman approaches my group to say we shouldn't be sitting there, and are reseated at a different section. Once we're reseated again, a third employee approaches us asking if we ""paid"" for the section, that line of questioning is unacceptable and I really feel as though the staff needs to communicate better. The drinks are overpriced with quality that is served. Way too much ice in the cups, the bartenders are slow, so either lack experience or aren't motivated to get drinks out faster.

Nest Restaurant & Lounge,"Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Event Planning & Services, Cocktail Bars, American (New), Restaurants, Venues & Event Spaces, Lounges, Bars","I've always tried to support this location through the many different restaurants/businesses that have held this space. So, I went to support the newest restaurant in this space, Nest. A couple of friends of mine held a small networking event here, and the only patrons in the restaurant at the time were the 10-15 of us who attended the event. I heard from a few people that arrived before me that they all ordered fries and had to wait a while because the chef had not arrived yet. I ordered a drink and was told they couldn't make the one I requested because they didn't have all of the ingredients. I ordered a different one, and the bartender made it exactly the way I liked it. She was very friendly. I was starving, so I ordered the chicken wings. Although, I felt they were a bit overpriced at $15. 4 other patrons ordered shrimp and grits and we played an ice breaker game for about 30- 35 mins. During the game, we had to request that the air conditioning be turned on because it was so hot and everyone was sweating. After we finished the game, we realized we still did not have our food. They went to go check, and came out with the shrimp dishes. Then I was told that ""THERE WAS AN ERROR WITH THE CHICKEN"" so I would have to order something else. What does that even mean? If I was unable to get the chicken, why was I not told that almost 40 minutes before when I made my order for the chicken wings? Being that I was starving and it took so long to get the original orders, I chose not to believe that it would only take 10 minutes to prepare anything else. There was barely an apology, and I was told they couldn't even comp my one drink for the inconvenience. I left and went to Morton's. I wish that I could say how the food was, but I never received any. My hope for them is that they will get better service, better customer service, and not end up like all of the previous businesses that have occupied this space.",1,0

I love the location, and how newly renovated it looks. The few things that will hurt this place is that it is below condos which prohibit them from playing loud music(In the event someone wants to plan a party there). There was an event held at this restaurant. There wasn't enough staff to help with the amount of people at the event. Some people were behind the bar and we had absolutely no idea what they were helping with. Once we were finally helped we had to order two or three drinks at a time plus our food because we were afraid that if the bartender walked away it would take another 15-20mins to come back. Finally, she received more help and things got better. I asked one bartender to put in my food order and something told me to confirm 10mins later and just as I thought the food was not put in and I had to order take out.",3,0

I never had artichokes that colored my egg whites before...must be a type of artichoke I've never had before The omelette itself lacked flavor. The country fried steak lacked flavor and the over medium eggs we ordered needed to be a little more cooked as the whites resembled clear slime just below the surface.

So today we went back to try again, boy that was a dumb idea!!!! Today it was daughter and I and i just looking for some lunch and we decided to give it a try again. We where sat with the same server from the first time we orders waters and a sprite and i orderd an iced coffee, i sent the coffee back because it tasted like it was 8 days old, again no personality from the server and i even apologized for her to have to take the coffee back, my daughter ordered the french toast and i orderd the tortilla soup. Our server shows up and slaps everthing on the table and walks away!!!! Guess what! The soup was cold and when i finally got her to come back over to our table she was aggravated that i did not want my cold soup!!! So i apologized again to her (should have been the other way around! !!!!) And i told her to please put in an order of steak and eggs med rare for me. While my daughter eats alone our server has disappeared and never checked on us. We waited for about 30 minutes with out drink refills and i finally flaged another person down to refill our waters.. guess who finally shows up? our server!! She slaps my steak and eggs down in front of me and walks away again... after waiting for 25 more minutes for her to return so i can tell her that i asked for med rare and not well done my daughter and I get up and walk to the counter and request for a manager. The manager ends up being our server!!!!!!! How... great.... yay!!! Had an attitude problem when I told her that I'm not paying for this entire experience except for the one thing we actually ate which was the French toast, she then insisted with an attitude oh it's okay I'll void the whole check! She then gave me an attitude when I told her no I would like to pay for the food that my daughter and I ate... she then rolled her eyes and walked away, the girl that was cashing us out at the podium was staring at me like I was speaking in ancient alien hieroglyphics, and was completely incompetent of not knowing what to do. I said you can ring me in for the French toast I would like to pay for that please since we did eat that and enjoyed it... after the hostess regains Consciousness and swipes my credit card for the French toast the manager comes over and has the audacity to yell at the Dazed and Confused creature for swiping me for the French toast.

We ordered the Tommy B omelette and 2 eggs benedicts. We hasked for crispy bacon in pmace of ham easy on the sauce. Well the headache begins no follow up service on coffee refills the bacon was not crispy sent back the eggs were nearly raw like a rush job and slothered in sauce. It seemed like they never remade the breakfast but added even more sauce to hide the fact. After being in the resturant for almost 1.5 hours sitting waiting on our order while other tables seated after us finished eating and left I think they lost our order in the shuffle and did not know until we said something then rushed the food out. Eggs uncooked fee liking like getting sick ? When we asked for the manager our server sent over another server guess she did not want to deal with us anymore she said he stepped out. She said we did not have to pay for the breakfast my husband said no we are not we are leaving she expected us to eat the raw eggs just because she said we did not have to pay for it.

The country fried steak had a nice light and crisp breading on the outside but was tender and so flavorful underneath the breading. The gravy was was just the right consistency of thickness and the flavor was on POINT! It came with two over-easy eggs cooked to perfection, which I happily dipped my perfect toasted wheat bread into. I love that there is never a wait no matter what day or time you show up. The servers are really nice and they take your order on an iphone. At first I was like, ""Is she TEXTING while taking our order!?? WTH!!"" but no, she was just being technologically savvy. The food came out so fast. You ALL know that the wait for breakfast seems to be SO much longer than the wait for any other meal, so it is quite a huge plus that the food is cooked quickly and served quicky here. This is one of my favorite breakfast spots. Great food, nice staff, quick service, relaxing atmosphere, clean restaurant...what more could you want?",5,1

It's not 5-star amazing, but a great option to have in the neighborhood and I like that they don't load up your entire plate with food.",4,1
New Day Cafe,"American (New), Breakfast & Brunch, Burgers, American (Traditional), Restaurants","This is a large, clean and bright coffee shop that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. We each ordered eggs Benedict that came with a choice of home fries (my wife) or hash browns (me). The eggs were cooked ""easy over"" as requested, but we thought the English muffin could have benefited from a little more time in the toaster. Also, the Hollandaise sauce was a little out-off-balance due to an excess of lemon juice.",2,0

New Day Cafe,"American (New), Breakfast & Brunch, Burgers, American (Traditional), Restaurants","Came here a few weeks ago with a hung-over friend. Place is cute, very airy, and our server chatted with us and was good about checking up. My friend had the veggie omelet and I had one with bacon and avocado. They diced the avocado into the omelet instead of just plopping it on top, which was a nice touch and kept my leftovers from going brown. We both liked the hash browns, they needed ketchup for sure, but to me all hash browns require ketchup. Hot tea selection was a nice array of options, it always irks me when a place charges you $2-3 for a plain Lipton bag.",4,1
Oaxaca Restaurante Y Cantina,"Restaurants, Mexican","Oaxaca was one of our most bizarre dining experiences. Our good friend adores their food at the airport, so we were anticipating some yummy food. As many people have noted, their salsa is weird. Ketchup salsa, yuck. So we asked our server for ""salsa, salsa."" She was confused and returned with a pico de gallo looking bowl. It turned out to be a partially frozen pico de gallo. So we gave up. The entrees including a nacho platter, enchiladas...were okay but nothing memorable. We sat outside in the patio area and were slowly overtaken by a hoarde of servers/bartenders in black attire milling about before the Saturday club scene. We watched the place transform from restaurant into a disco complete with creepy managers eyeing the female staff.",2,0

The first huge problem is the service. It's pretty sad when the best service you get is from the busboy. The waitress finally showed up and gave a lame excuse about being ""stuck"" at the bar. Some other waitress tried delivering the wrong drinks to our table and eventually we got a margaritas. Had to flag down our waitress to order our dinner after two baskets of chips. Sadly, we never got our food until the manager stopped by to find out how we were doing and we had to complain. Then, all the food including appetizer, salad and entre all came out together. The cheese crisp was so-so, and the carne asada burro was also just okay. The manager offered to comp us dessert but we declined. He was apologetic and said he had just been hired three ago. His first job should be to fire a bunch of waiters! Don't waste your time or money here until they figure out how to run a restaurant.",1,0

Oaxaca Restaurante Y Cantina,"Restaurants, Mexican","Oh this place used to be so good!!! I think it's under new management and since then, there is absolutely nothing special about this place. I decided to take some coworkers out to lunch here one day, we wound up back at work having eaten Taco Bell. First off it took the server 15 minutes to get us our menus. Then it took another 10 minutes just to get glasses of water. Finally after being there for a total of about 25 minutes I had to get up and ask the man standing at the front door if he could find someone to come over and take our order. After asking him to find someone to take our order, a disgruntled server came over and took all six of our orders. I explained to her that we were on a lunch break, and now barely had about 30 minutes to eat and get back to work. She assured me that the food would be coming very quickly. 25 minutes later we received our food. I was so upset I told her to forget it and to just bring us the bill for our drinks. She offered to wrap up our food so that we could take it to go! I explained to her that we intended on eating there, and were not planning on eating Mexican food in the car on our way back to work! She replied, extremely rudely, ""well I can't just let you have this food for free."" I told her I didn't expect any free food and wasn't planning on eating there ever again. My entire group wound up grabbing Taco Bell on the way back to work. I'm not sure if this place is under new management but, when I used to come here about six years ago, before the remodel, this place was amazing! They used to have the best, most authentic Mexican food in the valley what a shame. The man who I assumed was either the owner or the manager was completely useless. The waitstaff seems to run this place now and they are extremely rude! The attitude that I received from the server was such that I wouldn't touch their food with a 10 foot pole, as I have absolutely no guarantee that she didn't take my food back and spit in it. Before the remodel this place was so good! They used to have the most authentic green corn tamales, calabasitas, and the red chili sauce was absolutely incredible!!!! I am Hispanic, and I can say without a doubt I had a better lunch at Taco Bell with friendlier customer service. I will never set foot in this restaurant again, and I will never ever recommend it. You can remodel a building, but it doesn't make a damn bit of difference if the food and the customer service is this terrible.",1,0

I was giving a presentation that afternoon and didn't want to have anything too heavy.so I opted for the Grilled Chicken Burger off the ""Gringo"" menu. It was excellent. I came back the late afternoon the next day for a chicken burrito which was also very good. That time of day the place was almost empty and no one seemed to mind when I set up my laptop to get some work done for a few hours before heading to the airport. Just what I needed.

Oaxaca Restaurante Y Cantina,"Restaurants, Mexican","Won't be going back. I am always looking for a good Mexican place-- on a specific search for the best guac in greater Phoenix--, and one of my coworkers thought we should give it a try. The one good thing is the decor inside- it really is nice. Now on to the ""no bueno"" portion of our program... In summary, the food was bland, the food was cold, the service wasn't that great, and the salsa and the guacamole were just plain WEIRD. No need to overexplain bland and boring food (I had a chicken burrito, and I added cheese, rice, and sour cream), but I do want to point out that I ate GRISTLE in my chicken... which is what finally made me stop trying. Other items to note: 1. The server would barely glance at us, and when she came to ask for our order, she hadn't even asked for a drink order first. Also, we had to ask twice for more tortilla chips. I will say, though, that our main dishes came out fast... but mine was ice cold. 2. The flavor of the salsa was okay, but the texture was-- as another Yelper has described-- exactly like ketchup. Bizarre. 3. The guac. Oh the guac. Horrific. The first question was the pale green color. My friend and I spent at least 4 full minutes trying to figure out what one would mix with avocados to get that exact Lawrence Welk-era seafoam color. There was no onion, no peppers, no lime, NO flavor. After a few additional samplings (more out of morbid curiosity than anything), I came up with EGG. Yes, like hard-boiled egg whites. Color and texture. Bweck. To my food-loving compatriots out there: don't do it. Not worth your time or money.",1,0
Oaxaca Restaurante Y Cantina,"Restaurants, Mexican","Ketchup with some spice, that was their version of salsa. 10+ minutes until we could order, and it was not even good. Our visit started with a beggar outside of the door asking for money. We entered and were surprised by the pleasant decor. We waited a few min and were then seated. Once we were seated we had a good amount of time to look at the menu and the waitress took our drink order but was not even interested in our food order. A bus boy delivered s very small basket of chips and carafe of the ketchup based salsa. We finished this basket long before our order was taken. I ordered a Chillies rellno $4.99 a la cart. Most items are a bit pricier here. It took some time for our food to arrive. When it did I was surprised by the small size of the portion. The quality was also on the lower end the breading was not crisp and there was little to no sauce on it, very little cheese inside and a over-sized dollop of sour cream on top. We had to flag down the waitress for more water and chips which also took some time to come. Even the bill paying process was slow.",1,0
Oaxaca Restaurante Y Cantina,"Restaurants, Mexican","I went with a huge group, and since there was only one waitress there (they had to call another waiter to come in to help), the service was not great. One group got their food, and when they were almost finished eating, our orders were taken. They had burgers and fries on their menu which I thought was weird, under ""Gringo Food."" I got their chicken picado, pretty good, sauteed chicken with onions and peppers, with rice and beans and a good, large flour tortilla. Their chips and salsa were OK, pureed tomatoes, very spicy in little bottles. I ate so much of them because my food came out so late. The chairs were hard, it was a really large, empty restaurant with a somewhat bar-ish feel. Good to stop by if you're in the area but not worth a long trip.",3,0

The appetizer I ordered was forgotten about and was comped by our server ( A Nice Touch ). The entrees arrived and received a mixed review from our group. A chicken salad that had no dressing ? A chicken taco salad that also appeared to be missing something, salsa maybe ? The tortilla bowl was limp and soggy. Whats with the guacamole ? looks like they cut it with sour cream.

I was surprised to see such a nice looking restaurant in this area....maybe because I eat at my desk, maybe because the area is shady. The menu has your regular mexican items, which means refried beans to yours truly. That's okay, because I got a bean and cheese burrito and was happy to see it not smothered in melted cheese and a ton of sauce. Although I'm sure you can get it that way if you'd like. The chips and 2 salsa's were delicious, service was fast for a busy lunch crowd. The inside looks really modern, without the cheap and cheesy looking mexican decor.

It's a massive dining hall now, a bit up-scale even, but with a sports bar atmosphere (given the huge wide-screen tv as the new centerpiece). There's now a separate bar area, and a patio area that looks pretty cool.

Some construction has been going on for the past year or so to add on to this place but I really have no idea if and or when the new addition will be opened up. Let me recommend a few things: 1. The Chicken Soup-- this is white meat, rice, chicken broth and pico, with fresh avocado. It is my favorite thing on the menu. 2. Tacos and Enchiladas-- you can't go wrong. 3. Do not order quacomole. It is a green avocado-ish spread with cottage cheese. Not sure why or what this is about. 4. Lock your car in the parking lot.

It's one huge long table, and your group could be sitting next to strangers. It's fun, but the atmosphere is a little dark. The food is pretty good and they have some good imported and old beers. The bison burger there is amazing and generally, it's pretty cheap too. It's a nice place to go if you are going out on Queen Street for drinks after. I think it's a good place for groups, but the service is pretty bad. But me an my friends go back just for the bison burger. I would make a reservation if possible, but it's not usually that busy.

OddFellows,"American (New), Canadian (New), Restaurants","I first tried this place in 2008 when it first opened and I was floored. The friendly atmosphere created by the long harvest table, and the simple yet sophisticated gasto-cuisine created the perfect meal. It was also a great cross section of people - the post-work office crowd, local artsies, and older clientele. At that first visit I had their Buffalo meatloaf which was truly bliss on that cold March night. Summer brunch at OF was also quite good - their Breakfast for Two was a tad spicy, and very large, but on a lazy Sunday, with a couple of cups of coffee's, it's a great way to spend an hour on. That being said, even though my first couple of visits were stellar, I recently went back to see that the restaurant may have lost its way. On this occasion, inspite of my reservation, I had to wait 20 minutes for my seats to free-up, and was also ushered out around the 1.5 hour mark even though we were still on our mains (the kitchen was EXTREMELY slow). The food was also average and unimpressive, which capped off some minor changes to their menu items (for the worse). I'm willing to give this place another chance, maybe on a less volatile evening (it was very busy, I'll give them that), but I really hope that they're not trying to rest on their laurels too much.",3,0

We started with the fried pork belly and kimchi and it was just as good as it sounds. My date called his burger 'the best he's ever had', I had some fish which I didn't especially like, but that has not tarnished my opinion of this place in the slightest... sometimes you order the wrong thing...and sometimes your date orders something so spectacular that it makes anything and everything else pale in comparrison...

I met a friend here for dinner and had a very mediocre meal. The servers all screamed ""art-school college students""; it was hard for us to get their attention because they were too busy dealing with their own sense of entitlement.

OddFellows,"American (New), Canadian (New), Restaurants","This had all the makings of a great dinner. Cool space with magnetic walls, a gorgeous hanging fireplace, a single long communal table, interesting menu ranging from vegan to carnivore and plaid plaid galore. As soon as I walked in I felt like I'd stumbled upon some sort of space/time warp and ended up in Williamsburg on Queen St. Unfortunately, as prefaced by the star rating...Oddfellows proved the old adage, ""Don't judge a book by it's cover."" The lovely Kat F. had made us reservations at 9pm and strolling in two minutes before I was greeted with the small space, a full table and little bar seats to wait in. The frazzled bartender cum waiter looked a bit horrified when we told him we were here for our 9pm reservation and he told us to ""sit back and have a drink, those two are just about to leave"". Ok. I asked for a Greyhound. He replied, ""What's a Greyhound?"" Alright, so this guy's not a bartender. Kat asks about their spiked lemonade and after rifling around in a dirty floor fridge for a bit he brings out a plastic jug of pink sludge and says, ""We have some...juice."" Ick. I ask about the grapefruit for the Greyhound and he comes up for air with another dubious jug of concentrate and I concede and ask for Hendrick's which he denies they have until I point out the bottle on the shelf. This whole scene at a dive bar? Fine acceptable. But it was pretty ludicrous at a restaurant that charges $25 an entree to be served something you'd drink at a house party at 4am when everyone stops caring that the juice is expired and who knows where the booze came from. After continuing to wait, the time crept to 9:35 and we decided to order our food so that when we were seated we'd dive right in. 9:50 came around and after watching a homeless crazy do a round poking at diners before being thrown out, the frazzled guy kicks out the couple nursing their empty beer glasses that had been busy trying to decide whose glasses are more ironic. He puts plates of food at the seats and as an afterthought says, ""Oh, yeah you guys can go sit down now if you want."" Thanks? I ordered the salad, mysterious ""cream sauce"" on the side. It was, of course, soaked in said cream sauce but my hunger overpowered. I mostly gravitated toward the croutons as the iceberg lettuce was a bit...chewy. As an entree I had the pork pelly, rabbit and fig compote. I was mostly attracted to the pork belly but it came out...cold. Blech. Word to the wise, never eat cold pork belly...imagine chewing on layers of cold bacon fat. The rabbit stuff could be best described as tuna salad...it was the best tasting thing on the plate though so I gobbled up the mystery goo. Then there was a fig compote that was just a ridiculous addition as it was so potent that I couldn't figure out how it was supposed to compliment the bland meet piles. Kat insisted we go for the brownie a la mode to save our meal and that truly was a gooey hot ""forgive us"" though my patience was beyond tested at that point. Perhaps it was an off night but I can't imagine how this place survives. The other diners at our long communal table seemed to all be friends with the owner and kept walking in and out of the kitchen and stoking the fireplace etc. It was like being at a dinner party where we didn't know the hosts or the other guests yet tried to be polite about the food even though nobody's really asking you if you like it anyway.",1,0
OddFellows,"American (New), Canadian (New), Restaurants","After a afternoon of slinging back tall cans with friends in Trinity Bellwoods park on a hot summer day, naturally we were looking for food to absorb all the booze. Oddfellows was suggested by a friend and we were sold. The place is cozy and i love the minimalistic decor with a few choice pieces around the place. I love the communal cafeteria style table right in the middle of the room. That being said you might have to wait a while on a busy night due to the small amount of seats. On to the food.......I ordered the Vegan Stew. It was hands down one of the tastiest meals I had in my life. I had to refrain myself from licking the bowl. The menu itself will please anyone. My friends ordered the quail, the tempeh club and the pork butt. There was a really good variety of food for everyone. The service was good, they played good punk rock music which prompted a couple of quiet singalongs. The only draw back is that is some of the meals were on the pricey side, but it's well worth saving up and treating your tummy to some good good food.",4,1
OddFellows,"American (New), Canadian (New), Restaurants","On my second visit here, I have to say that the overall ""experience"" here actually dragged OddFellows' rating down to a measly 3 stars. It is a happy median between 4-star quality food, but 2-star everything else. By ""everything else"", I mean service, overheating your customers, and a general snootiness that I guess comes with Castor territory. We called about 5 days in advance to book a table for that Friday evening, and they informed us that had to make up our mind about the precise number of seats (we told them 6 for sure, possible 7), otherwise we were out of luck. Hm, okay... Apparently they were to be so busy that not a single chair could go wasted. Also, we were informed that we could only stay until 9 pm. Um, fine. Upon our arrival we were surprised to see that we were the only ones at the table (there were a couple of people out on the patio), and to our dismay, despite the scorching weather, there was no AC, not even a fan in sight. It was so hot that we all sweated through the entire meal, and one of our party even had to go out and get air to keep from passing out. For the two hours that we were there the entire row of tables remained empty, save for a couple people who sauntered in, only to saunter back out (heat? kicked out because they didn't have reservations?). After all that reservation hubbub, it looked like it was all much ado about nothing. Service - not friendly, but we were serviced well enough. My friend did request salad dressing on the side, which didn't happen. A small slip-up. Food, on the other hand, is excellent (albeit a little pricey for what it is). I enjoyed the tempeh sandwich (huge! enough for two people), which normally comes with a side of fries, but they obliged to my 1/2 fries-1/2 salad request. Yes, I'm one of those people. Delicious, and to my surprise, the salad was perhaps the star of the dish. Dressed with what seemed to be dried blueberries, among other goodies, the salad was outstanding, summery, and unique. I've heard great things about their brunch, perhaps it may be busier which could help with the atmosphere. And if only they could just get over themselves.",3,0
OddFellows,"American (New), Canadian (New), Restaurants","Unusual restaurant as suggested by the name. Yes, everything about it is a bit odd. I read somewhere it was owned or designed by artists. The ceiling above the bar is cluttered by various sorts of light bulbs in a sculpture. The seating was also strange as it was one long table with chairs on both sides and ends. There was a group of 4 at one end near the window, so we sat at the other end; very reminiscent of high school cafeteria style seating. Water came in a large Grolsch swing top bottle. Espresso came in a clear drinking glass..... This place, I think, is meant to engage your visual senses as much as taste and smell - which scores it a point. One wall opposite the door is made of metal and littered with everything from alphabetic magnets, to a sculpture of a head with red tape over the eyes and mouth. I don't know what is with this place and red tape....., but they seem to think it's a charming decorating motif as you'll see it scattered about the restaurant in various areas. Brunch menu was quite limited with only 5-7 items to choose from including Omelettes, Buck Wheat cakes with fruit [which I had]. For a breakfast I thought it was rather expensive at $12-16 per plate. The menu states that for groups 4 or larger they add 15% gratuity. So don't come here unless you enjoy enforced tipping. However, despite the weirdness, they definitely knew how to cook. My waffles were made from healthy whole grain flower: buckwheat! Combination of blueberries, blackberries, oranges, fried bananas, and whipped cream was lovely. All in all, I don't think I would return for a second visit primarily because of how unnatural the whole place feels. No signs for washroom [one shared by all guests], one long table, weird sculptures all around you. I should mention they have bench seating outdoors as well, and there are windows on three sides of the room so it's quite bright.",2,0

The only thing that gives this place away is the long communal table on the inside barely visible from outside. The communal table is an interesting concept and one that works. I've been here several times and always end up talking to new people, a very rare feet in Toronto. I'm sure many unexpected good times are had at this very long marble table and new friends made. The artwork inside is very interesting with foam heads red taped to chains, antler headphones, light fixtures made of various light bulbs, and the giant magnetic board is also a nice touch. The patio is covered by an army camo tarp and is just another quirky addition to the already eclectic decor. The service here is great! The servers are very friendly, knowledgeable, and personable. It feels as if they are old friends. Pairing suggestions are great and they are also pretty good and food suggestions too. Saturday and Friday nights are very busy and the bartender is working away at cocktails and the cook staff are rammed but the servers keep their cool and collected and handle everything with ease. Food here is very good. Although the menu is quite small the quality of food is quite spectacular. They have something covered for herbivores and omnivores alike. If you are a picky eater though, you may want to look elsewhere as the choices are fairly limited. I find it better to have a smaller menu as it helps me choose as the options are already narrowed down. Overall, it's always a fun time out when at Oddfellows as long as your are with the right people. Come with people that are open to meeting new people and don't mind sitting in a table full of strangers, they also can't be too picky an eater. If you have a few friends like this then they'll love it here. If not, then you'll meet them here. Food is good and prices are reasonable. Hard to not like this little hidden gem.",4,1
OddFellows,"American (New), Canadian (New), Restaurants","I have been meaning to go to Oddfellows for quite some time now. Never really made it out because my usual dinner partner is not a fan of the communal table. Finally made it out on Friday with a large group. The service was great and I had the amazing pork belly ribs. I also tried the flat-iron steak, thanks to a pal, and I was just as impressed. I hear that the breakfast is dope too, but I'll have to check back on that. Post dinner, the entire group basically hung our and drank until closing and we were always treated with the utmost respect and I honestly cannot wait to go back. The beers were also pretty inexpensive, all considered. I honestly cannot wait to go back, eat some pork belly and a drink a bunch of $3.50 PBRs! Thanks Oddfellows for hosting a fantastic bachelor party.",5,1
OddFellows,"American (New), Canadian (New), Restaurants","This place is fun fun fun. Not for the faint of heart as the music blasts, the conversation and drinks flow, and the flavours can be intense. But when it comes to weekend dining that is just what I'm looking for. As though it's a little oasis of foreign soil, it's a great place for random conversation with your neighbour (not Toronto's specialty). The amazing stew-for-two feeds at least three, and I find that it attracts characters of all ages and types, so you'll be dining with some built in entertainment. One of my go-tos. I'm withholding the 5th star ONLY because the brunch is middling (though the atmosphere still brings me out)",4,1
OddFellows,"American (New), Canadian (New), Restaurants","From first glance, there is nothing going on here. On a funny corner, surrounded by Style Garage and CAMH, it looks like an abandoned building, perhaps an artist's space. Step inside though and you're welcomed into a communal dining experience that I initially found off-putting, but warmed to. My friend had been before, and I was taking him for his birthday, so trusting his foodie sense, I was excited. The long communal table made me hungry as our neighbors food arrived while we were waiting, hungry - it did help me decide what I wanted to order though! I had the pork ribs, an unusual choice for me, and I loved every bite. There wasn't a bad thing to say about the food at all. The staff was fast enough, the one guy I remember as vacant stare man from the Victory Café and he lived up to my memories. At least he was on top of his game here. After dinner when I was more in the mood for dessert, it was a bit weird to smell the stew a few seats away from us. A slight downside to the communal concept, but at the same time it was fun to share the experience with others and watch them dig in. Only one real lame point to me which was the effort that went into small things (not the décor though, that was fantastic!). The food is worth every pretty penny it costs, but you'd think they'd have a real soap dispenser, or would serve drinks in a way that would make them also appealing. I can't stand when a place cheaps out on the small things, thinking their food will make up for it. To each their own though! I must go back after dinner hours for $3 grilled cheese because I love to scour the city for the best.",4,1
OddFellows,"American (New), Canadian (New), Restaurants","Oddfellows has a unique charm about it. Despite waiting a crazy amount of time to have our order taken and then to get our food I found the place relaxed me when normally I would have been getting the early morning low-blood sugar and caffeine-withdrawal rage. We did come when it was jammed and every spot at the long table was filled but it is a small place. Waiting patiently, I found myself drooling over my neighbours plates of nearly finished food. When we got our hearty and healthy looking eggs benny (but with asparagus and tomatoes) I was both pleased (the veggies were awesome) and displeased (eggs were overcooked and on the cold side). If I'd only had coffee in this cool and kooky place I would've given it 5 stars - it was the best cup of coffee I've had in years. Deee-licious!",4,1
OddFellows,"American (New), Canadian (New), Restaurants","This brings life to Queen West dining / entertainment. The place is actually owned and operated by a design group - Castro Design. This is why this place looks and feels as if your in a modern / Eco / wilderness type social environment. Its simply amazing. I happened to get there after dinner was served, but had just an amazing experience. What I like best is the people. I truly believe the people that visit the bar get the concept, and create an atmosphere that is open and inviting. You do not get that from many places in the city. I heard the venison burger is amazing, so I will definitely have to go back. One more thing - call ahead for reservations!",4,1
OddFellows,"American (New), Canadian (New), Restaurants","One of my new fave restaurants in the city. It's rare to find a place that puts just as much thought into their vegetarian dishes as their meat dishes. Rare and refreshing. With no sign out front, and just a menu taped to the window, the first time we walked by this place, we thought it was a private party. One big long marble table, with people sitting all the way around it, conversing over imported beers and wine. The communal seating idea is wonderful, and we always meet lovely people and have fantastic conversations over dinner. You get a real feeling of community, in a city that isn't known for it. The interior is filled with recycled-bulb light fixtures, a cozy fireplace suspended off the floor, soft-lighting and flickering candles, and interesting wall installations, all worthy of placement in the MOMA. The ""Herbivore Stew"" and ""Veggie Pasta"" on the menu changes every week from my experience, which means there's always something new and exciting to try. One of the best things I had there was a pasta dish with a tomato and butternut squash sauce, and pumpkin seed pesto with shaved cheese on top. The duck pate, served with honey and nuts, is beyond description. The wild boar or venison burgers are rightfully popular. I've eaten there a few times now, and the staff always remember us, and our favourite dishes. The chefs are always around to give feedback to, and seem to really appreciate it and take it seriously, as they constantly are developing new dishes. It's great to speak to everyone around the table and hear their thoughts on the food they're eating. I've even seen young families walk in with their kids!! You MUST make sure you have room to try the brownie after your meal. Life is not complete without it. After dinner hours, they offer drinks and $3 grilled cheese until close. I've also heard good things about their brunch and all-you-can-eat Grazing Mondays spread. Couldn't have imagined a better restaurant myself. Best kept secret in the city.",5,1
Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","We were regular delivery customers for almost a year. They are open late for those random General Tso cravings.

Never again. Very disappointed. If you are out of the meat for the day, please call your customers. We would of gladly ordered something else.",2,0
Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","Ordered for delivery from Orient House easily through the Yelp app. The food was good for the price, packaged well with sauces and utensils, and was delivered on time. While it certainly wasn't the best Chinese I've ever had, it was a great value for the price and it did the trick. The fried rice was my favorite part of the meal because it wasn't too greasy and it was more flavorful than other fried rice dishes I've had.",4,1

Also, he indicated he can eat his breakfast, lunch and dinner in this restaurant every day for one year and never get fed up. Haha, both of us like this place very much. Recommended dishes are beef rolls, veggie baozi, youtiao, soy milk and lamb spine hot pot.",5,1

Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","This place has a sprawling menu (far too much for just one trip) but after two months traveling in China--this is the only place I've found that has food that feels as good. The first time I went in, only one other table was occupied (and there are lots of tables); the second time, every table was occupied or being turned around. It's family run and the service is polite. The beef roll is very good; this time I tried their spicy pulled pork flatbread creation and ordered two more to take home. It took a sec. to find at the tip of Monona--I doubt you'll regret tracking it down.",5,1
Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","Great first impression. Just had dumplings delivered, they were hot and delicious! I will be back to explore more of the menu!",5,1
Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","This is our favorite Chinese place in Madison, hands down. We make a visit every time we are in town. We live on the west coast where the Chinese cuisine is ample, but this is about as authentic as it gets. Don't be intimidated by the huge menu. They have what seems like a hundred specials plastered on their walls in addition to the printed menu, but it's all there for a reason. I suggest trying the Northern Chinese dough-based specialties that they are known for, like the slightly spicy pulled pork stuffed in delicious bread. Amazing...and inexpensive. We haven't gone wrong yet with house recommendations even if some of the menu items are in Chinese only.",5,1
Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","This is without a doubt the worst ordering experience I've ever had! They gave us the wrong kind of spring rolls, and the crispy pork intestines are not crispy at all! I mean if you are going to make Chinese food, at least show some efforts! The delivery was terrible too! The paper bag was half covered in oil when I got it, and the sauce inside was all spilled out! And they never even give you chopsticks even if you ask for them! I didn't know Madison has such a terrible Chinese restaurant until today! BE WARNED!!! Never order from this place unless you want to try the worst Chinese food in the WORLD!!!",1,0
Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","Chinese food is my absolute favorite so I was more than thrilled to find a restaurant that delivers so close to my work. When the food arrived I was immediately put off by the less than friendly delivery driver. On top of that, the dumplings I ordered were cold and - I kid you not - had a spider stuck to one of them. I will NEVER order from this place again. DISGUSTING!",1,0
Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese",This is my favorite Chinese food in Madison. Wonderful Americanized Chinese menu as well as a rather intimidating authentic Chinese menu.

Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","Was relatively cheap. Ordered on a Thursday evening at 7:15 and they estimated a 45 minute arrival.

Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","I came for dinner with my husband, 3 year old, and 10 month old. We were instantly greeted. The place has got the relaxed atmosphere of a lunch spot, so nothing too fancy which I liked since we had kids with us. Everything was super clean down to the bathroom, which could have sparkled. Only downside, no place to change a baby. Food was good. It's served in a family sharing kind of way, where they give you huge plates and you scoop it onto your smaller plate. We ordered way to much and ended up taking a lot home. (which we were more than happy to do) Dishes came out piping hot. The server was super friendly, although didn't have perfect English, she couldn't have been more polite. She was asking me if I wanted more soda before I could even finish it so we were well attended to. I was surprised quickly food was sent out to us. Everything is very fairly priced. All and all, great experience!",4,1
Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","Were regular customers of Orient House under the previous owners. The real Chinese dishes are what attracted us after experiencing Chinese from Szchechuan to Beijing to Inner Mongolia and OH made some of my favorites. Today was first time having their food since they reopened. Ordered takeout (we almost always ate in before) and was extremely disappointed. First, the traditional Chinese dishes were gone--was told they threw away too much food--??? Told the Americanized Chinese menu was the same, same cook. Well, something went wrong. Ordered the Chicken corn soup--smaller portion, don't strain your eyes looking for the chicken. Moo shu chicken--everything was so shredded you could hardly tell what was hidden under the overall brown mass of sauce--no discernible pieces of chicken, mushrooms, carrots, etc. although seemed like lots of cabbage and it had a definite and uncharacteristic amount of heat to it. Moo shu isn't supposed to have heat!!!. And looked like flour tortillas instead of thin wrappers and only about a tablespoon of Hoisin sauce. Spring rolls were mostly cabbage, with only flecks of carrot and green onion; could find no protein in them and I think they are smaller. The shredded pork with garlic sauce was a favorite at the old OH but this dish was shredded pork with a pinkish sauce that was as thin as water and tasted only of sugar--no garlic taste at all--and something shredded so finely I couldn't tell if it was green onion or cabbage or what and very little of that. If they have the same cook, they certainly have not kept the same ingredients and cooking style and this food doesn't resemble any of the great food served previously. We will definitely NOT be going there again. Bu hao! (Not good in Mandarin).",1,0
Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","Orient House - once a 5 star restaurant- how now changed management as of early November 2013. I was extremely sad to see the old staff go. They were so welcoming and gave us special orders like Vegetable Soup even though it wasn't on the menu. Now, with new management, all ties of ordering off the menu foods are gone. Fried rice has changed and so have the chicken they use for sweet and sour chicken. It is much harder and the portions are much smaller. For those who are use to the old Orient House may find that they do not like the new change. I certainly do not. Very, Very sad what the new management changed to the menu including prices and taken off at least 1/2 of the options that were available under previous management.",2,0

Not sure what has changed in the past month (the menu that came with my last order said ""under new ownership"") but the delivery service has gone WAY downhill. I thought it was a fluke a few weeks ago when my food took an hour and a half to arrive on a random weeknight. But the same thing happened again - except this time it took two hours.

Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","For the price, it was average, but for the food and portions, I didn't mind the cost so much. We dined in on a weekend (lunch), and it was empty so we didn't know initially if it was open. The server/hostess was very nice and our orders were quick to come out. We also saw some people come in to pick up orders, so I'm assuming ordering/calling for pickup is an option. We ordered the usual, general's chicken, broccoli beef, orange chicken, and fried rice. Awesome as far as taste goes, so I would definitely recommend if you like flavorful dishes. I took away a star only cause the little entryway has a lingering smell of garbage/alleyway dumpster and it put me off before we even started ordering, kind of like if someone recently took out the trash. Luckily the yummy food saved my appetite.",4,1
Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","""It reminds me of a bowling area"" This summarizes my experience. The red flat carpet with trails of commonly traversed area, the half panelled walls, the overall atmosphere. I'm not necessarily opposed to restaurants where the decor isn't fancy, but it means that the food must be delicious. And it was just meh. We were given the paper ""American"" menus, which did have a few items like instestine and kidney, but there were probably a few dishes missing from the ""secret menu"". But it's just plain depressing to receive the same menu that you put on your fridge when you are doing sit down service. As for the food, it was OK, the rice portion per person was quite small. My tofu was cold in some areas of the dish, warm in others. This location is like a plague for businesses, I swear. Maybe because of the wood panelling.",2,0

We got delivery, and even though we were technically outside their delivery zone, they took our order and delivered the yummy food within 30 minutes. Friendly and reasonably priced.

The walnut shrimp was right on, delicious, and rivals some of the Chinese restaurants that I've been to in NYC, San Francisco, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. I will definitely be a repeat customer.",4,1

The atmosphere wasn't the best. Music was some sort of country rock, the tv up front had a cartoon on it with the sound down way low. I felt more like I was eating at a fast food place rather than at a Chinese Restaurant. If they can clean up the atmosphere I would put them to 5 stars. Good and friendly service too. Great prices. Inexpensive for a good quantity of food. Have returned a number of times. Everything very good so far. Most recent visit we received helpful, friendly and speedy service. The food was excellent, full of flavor. Thank goodness because the regular Chinese food stops have really gone downhill when it comes to good flavor. The chop suey, chicken fried rice and the Szechuan chicken were very good to perfect. Thank you Orient House for being there.",4,1

Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","Background: I lived in Beijing ten years ago, and I basically haven't eaten Chinese food since. I simply have not found any Chinese food worth eating in Madison or Milwaukee, and after a while I gave up looking. A few weeks ago, another friend who also has lived in Beijing, and is lucky enough to live a few blocks from Orient House, sent me a near-frantic e-mail announcing that she had found real Chinese food in Madison. This was monumental. I thought about it every day for the week I had to wait to get to Madison. First of all, order off the Chinese menu. And eat family style. There are plenty of things that even a not-too adventurous eater will like. You may need to like spicy food. For example, try the spicy string beans - I ate these probably four times a week in Beijing - and I think they are just as good here. There are just no green bean like these green beans. Try them. We also got something called fried chicken with dried peppers, which was very tasty small pieces of fried chicken tossed with green onions and hot peppers. Really good. Finally, we ordered yu xiang xie zi, which I unfortunately don't know the exact translation for, although I think it is listed on the Chinese menu as Eggplant in garlic sauce. This is a dish I have thought about for years. It's sticks of eggplant cooked until perfect soft and drenched in a sauce that I don't know how to describe other than to say it's very delicious. My only regret about this meal is that we didn't have about six more people with us so that we could have sat around the lazy susan and tried a lot more dishes. Everything that passed by me reminded me of China. I saw lots of amazing-looking veggies dishes, lots of saucy delicious-I'm-sure pork plates, and generally the menu had me wanting more. I can't wait to go back.",5,1
Orient House,"Restaurants, Chinese","This is definitely the best Chinese restaurant in Madison. The crab rangoon was good, pretty generic. What really stood out was their fried rice. I don't normally order pork fried rice, but my dad ordered some for the table and the flavor was phenomenal.

Philly Pretzel Factory,"American (New), Restaurants, Pretzels, Food","No! No way! I never thought I'd be saying this, but I found a pretzel that exceeds The Pretzel Shop on the South Side. Ever since my first visit to Philly when I was eight years old, I fell in love with those pretzel street vendors selling those amazing crunchy, chewy, salty treats. Each vender seemed to have a different mustard. Didn't matter, I wanted soft pretzels. I remember my older cousin Frankie taking me to a place near Betsy Ross' house. A portly man, quick witted, W.C. Fields nose, white hair, reminded you of someone's grandfather. Frankie ordered two pretzels and the man squeezed the most amazing mustard on them. We sat on a stoop (Philly speak for steps) and shared a conversation about baseball and we downed those pretzels like they were the last meal we were ever going to eat. Sorry I got off the subject.... After working out at LA Fitness I needed some carbs, I saw the Philly Soft Pretzel Factory and pulled in. My mind was transported back to Philly for just a moment. These looked like the ones W.C. Field's sold out of his cart. I ordered one and went outside on the stoop and took a bite. Cue the harp and fade out like a dream sequence from the 60's TV shows. I was eight years old, Frankie was 17 again, still the same cheesy teen boy mustache, I was wearing P F Flyers, I had on a horrible striped shirt like I was on the TV show Zoom, and a mustard gold Pirates cap on my head. Frankie was showing me on a map where Shibe Park used to be, and how close we were to the Liberty Bell. We'd go there after we finished our pretzels. He wiped the mustard off my face, straightened my hat, told me he'd buy me a Phillie's cap and we walked to the car. Back to the present. It's amazing how a food, or a smell can take you back to simpler times, when all you had to do in life was pass your classes and do homework. The pretzels they sell here remind me of the one they sell on the carts in Philly. They also have Pretzel sandwiches and Pretzel wrapped hot dogs The real hot dogs with the natural casings. If there's no parking on the South Side, head over to Collier and hit this place up. If you've ever had one in Philly, be prepared to take a trip there in your mind. PS I still have that Phillie's cap. I need to call Frankie.",4,1
Philly Pretzel Factory,"American (New), Restaurants, Pretzels, Food","Members in my office occasionally bring in soft pretzels from Philly Pretzel Factory, and they did again this morning. Now, I am a FIEND for soft pretzels and what I have sampled from here ROCKS!!!! Always warm and oh so soft I am reminded of my bed. And they don't over use the salt like most concession stands you may run into at a sporting event. They have plain and cinnamon flavors as well as a wonderful variety of dips! They have: minis, rivets (they are like bite sized nuggets), pretzel dogs and sausage, and stuffed pretzels (think buffalo chicken or cheese steak!!!). What really makes this place stand out are customized shaped pretzels, in addition to their already unique shape that looks more like a chain link than the typical twist! I haven't seen any of these in person, but the pic on the website shows a collection of sea creatures, such as lobsters and crabs. They look really awesome! I bet customized pretzels would really be neat at a bridal or baby shower! I WILL visit in person and have a cheese steak! I WILL!!! Also look for their office deal: 50 pretzels for 15$ before 9am!!!!!",5,1

Pho Tién Phát,"Restaurants, Vegetarian, Food, Bubble Tea, Vietnamese","Had the vermicelli noodles with beef and the fried spring roll. It came with a good portion of noodles and okay amount of meat but the beef wasn't as flavourful as I would have liked. The spring roll was good! Spring mix was good too. But the nuoc mam/fish sauce to accompany the noodles wassuper diluted and wasn't enough to accommodate the dish. I saw some other reviews saying that the tips were included but I'm unsure if they have continued to do that. Our bill came out correctly with 13% tax. In addition, my mom had the pho and was super thirsty afterwards which is a sign of MSG.",2,0
Pho Tién Phát,"Restaurants, Vegetarian, Food, Bubble Tea, Vietnamese","Amazing amazing place, super authentic! Love the wraps, the two of us ordered for three and finished everything. Highly recommend if you want an authentic Vietnamese experience. Honestly it was a five star review in the beginning however........the business was being very unethical, for a party of two, they included the tip in the total of the bill without telling us. It was literally a hand written slip that shows you 'total = $XX.XX' no where does it tell you a tip was added. My friend ended up paying two tips. We didn't figure this out until we were en route home. The food was great but this unethical act left a sour taste in our mouth.....",2,0
Pho Tién Phát,"Restaurants, Vegetarian, Food, Bubble Tea, Vietnamese","I came here with a friend to have a quick meal after a couple hours on the road. The server was quick and the food came out fast (kind of expected since we ordered pho). I was pleasantly surprised when they brought out spoons and chopsticks being sanitized in hot water. I've never seen this done in a Vietnamese restaurant and really appreciated it. Pho noodle soup (large size with tendon, beef flank, tripe): Overall a solid bowl of pho with flavourful broth and generous amounts of beef and tendon. This was probably the most toppings I've received in a bowl of pho (and I've had my fair share of pho) and it was awesome! Avocado shake: my go-to drink at any Vietnamese restaurant. Love the smooth creaminess when real avocados are used. The flavour of the drink was great, however I believe they made it ahead of time and froze it. The drink was not fully thawed and was too solid to drink. I ended up letting it thaw out for a couple of hours before being able to enjoy it fully. If you ever crave a hot bowl of pho this is a good place to get it.",4,1

My husband ordered the Rare Beef Rice Noodle Soup (Pho Tai), and I had the Chicken Tom Yum Soup (Sup Tom Yum Ga). The soup I had certainly was hot and spicy, which I liked but I prefer the vegetables cooked more and softer. If you ever talk with someone who has an ostomy, you will understand.",4,1

I don't understand the language but really like the tune. Booth is also available which we like. They offer delicious pho with competitive pricing. I wouldn't say it's ""dirt cheap"" but hey they take debit/credit cards here. Their menu has a wide selection, besides pho and vermicelli; Thai hot pot and congee looks really tempting. Attentive and efficient service. I am very happy to find another great pho place in North York. Will definitely come back.",5,1
Pho Tién Phát,"Restaurants, Vegetarian, Food, Bubble Tea, Vietnamese","I came here on a weekday and it was really quiet and the service was adequate. Drinks: I started off with a cold vietnamese coffee. It tasted great. But I felt like 80% of my cup was ice cubes and there was barely any coffee for $3.50 so I will probably order the hot version next time. Food: My friend got the special beef pho. Nothing spectacular, it is just like any other beef pho. I ordered the grilled pork chop platter with steamed egg and fried egg. The pork chop was tender. The food was decent but I will NOT return based on how unethical this business is. They intentionally increase the price of the grand total when they hand you the total bill thinking that customers do not notice... They add tips to the total of the bill without informing customers. The paper bill just says ""total"" and the total amount. It does not include any calculation. Most customers will assume this total amount is just the subtotal with taxes. But NOPE, it includes tips. This is very unethical of this business. I know they are intentionally doing it because I paid with cash, and they gave me change and it was my natural instinct to leave a tip. Afterwards I thought to myself that the ""total amount"" on the bill didn't seem very right, so I grabbed my phone out to do the calculations and I realized they actually increased the ""total amount"" written on the bill. I was already in my car when I realized I had in fact gave them tips TWICE without realizing and they accepted it. This business is very sneaky and I don't appreciate their way of doing business. I highly advise everyone to calculate the total amount on the paper bill because they definitely increase the amount.",1,0

We got our beer and and water and waited for over 10 minutes. I finially asked the man making the hookahs how much longer and he knew nothing about our order. Then I asked Z and she said he was new and we should be sympathetic, but it was not his fault she did not tell him our order. She tried to blame it on him.

He additionally had two tables sitting outside that he had to wait in addition to the walk-ins. -We ordered two chicken salads and two side dips, and it ended up being nearly $40. This is Pita House, not the Persian Room. The 'Greek Salad' was essentially a simple bed of lettuce with 1 Chicken Kabob. The Kabob of chicken was $5 plus an upcharge of $1 for making it kabob.

As you can see, the $14 salad is as big as its receipt. -The prices listed on the menu ""vary"". -Dirty I love Middle Eastern food and don't know how this place is still in business.

The area that a customer is usually greeted and order taken was dirty and not attended. I actually had to call them on my phone to get someone to help me. They were unapologetic and indifferent when I told them I couldn't find anyone to take my order. The food was very mediocre and the gyros disappointing. The meat had obviously been frozen and tasted mushy and flavorless. It lacked the Tzatziki sauce I like and the tabouli was very tart.

These gyros had maybe 2 thin and skinny slices of meat on them but where they lacked meat, they over compensated with an insane amount of sauce. The salads that accompanied the sandwiches was nothing more than dried out, wilted lettuce with a white tomato sliver. If this wasn't an Old Town tourist trap location that offered a full bar, hookah bar and late night service, odds are they would have gone out of business a long time ago. Don't expect any shade on their patio, as they have 1 functioning umbrella and 1 non-functioning umbrella. The good news is we now know where not to go for good, authentic Middle Eastern cuisine.

Obviously a first timer, the waitress seemed bemused by my newness and uncompelled to offer any assistance. Maybe she knew I wasn't returning before I did.

Pita Jungle,"Middle Eastern, American (New), Restaurants, Mediterranean, Vegetarian, Greek","So I came to pita jungle for the first time with a bunch of friends from California visiting. We were all not impressed. Well I mean w the service. We came all the way from north phoenix and we were all extremely hung over so it kind of made the experience kind of worst. But no that's not why it was a bad experience. We had to wait about 15 mins for our drinks, I had no cuttery so I had to steal my roommates, she was just slow. I don't know if she was new or not but the restaurant was like empty. I'm a server and I'm sorry if your service is that slow when the place is practically empty then you shouldnt be a server. Despite the horrible service, the food was good, I had the blackbean burger and it was so good. Everything was good because everyone got something different and they all were satisfied. The restaurant was cool it was totally my style. The staff seemed super chill and friendly. Oh and I totally want thay awesome wine rack they have when you first walk in. But I will totally be back maybe not to this location but one closer",3,0
Pita Jungle,"Middle Eastern, American (New), Restaurants, Mediterranean, Vegetarian, Greek","I walked in this afternoon CRAVING the (insert long name) Chicken Shawarma, walked by a table while we were being seated and I know I was probably gawking, but I wasn't drooling -yet. Why in the world would Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini cause such a reaction?! I mean it's Cauliflower. I have a thing for Cauliflower, so we ordered it. This afternoon I decided to try something new and this was just a start. My lunch choice is Beef Kafka. The starter was good. I want the recipe or at least the basic instructions. Nice touch with the Pine Nuts and Onions. The Beef Kafka is what I would call a Mediterranean version of a Tostada, or maybe Nachos. Lavosh topped with cheese, beef, tomatoes, grilled onions, jalapeños, green onion, Pine nuts, and a creamy sauce lightly across the length. The flavors blended well. If possible the flavors blended TOO well. I enjoy being able to differentiate the flavors of the various items that come together to create a dish, this one wasn't giving me that. May be one of the reasons I like Shawarma? Don't get me wring, the Beef Kafka was good but I couldn't keep my gaze from wandering over to my sons meal. What do you call that? Oh yeah, Pesto Pizza on Lavosh for $1.50 more. Maybe I'll try that next time. Our server was super sweet and darned efficient too. We talked briefly before I ordered cuz my son had stepped away momentarily. So yah, uh huh, she thought it was a date scenario and didn't realize that I was the young mans mother. Oh Jiminy and Jay Jose' Phat ().... Yep, Mom here. So we giggled for a minute and it was back to business. Pita Jungle is one of those places I like to go to occasionally cuz I don't want to get bored with the menu. The relaxed atmosphere appears naturally well lit which makes being able to see the menu a real possibility. Art by local talent is promintly displayed, the nearby water feature provides a peaceful view, and the decor is eclectic (?), Bohemian (?), or simply a crazy mish mash of someone's personal style. I'll be back again soon for the Jalapeño and Cilantro Hummus and Chicken Shawarma. OH yeah, that Cauliflower dish I mentioned, I saw several more orders go out while we were there. Must be a popular item. And I almost forgot to mention something I didn't like. Soda/tea for almost $3.00. -I almost spit up. I guess that might be a way to discourage people from drinking soda, but tea? Or maybe they're trying to encourage customers to order a beer or wine instead? Basically I just really dislike the idea of paying more than a buck fifty for soda. K, 'nuff from me.",4,1
Pita Jungle,"Middle Eastern, American (New), Restaurants, Mediterranean, Vegetarian, Greek",Thanks for serving me rotten artichoke. Thanks for not chomping the meal. This place is either great or horrible. It could possibly be most inconsistent restaurant I have ever gone too. The manager comes over and apologies but doesn't comp the meal. And doesnt assure me it will never happen again. I believe he said I checked and didnt see any more rotten ones. No kidding they are not all rotten. Rotate your food to ensure its always fresh. Restarant 101. Obviously I have to continue to expext more of the same.,1,0

Pita Jungle,"Middle Eastern, American (New), Restaurants, Mediterranean, Vegetarian, Greek","I normally order the Gambos Con Ajo and kids normally get the traditional hummus. I have been going to this location for the past 3 years and is a huge fan. From location to location the taste is slightly off but tonight, it was way off at one of the best tasting locations that I LOVE to dine at (Chandler). My Gambos dish was very sour, it tasted like they forgot the garlic and put a dash too much tomato paste. As a matter of fact that was all that I had tasted. My children's hummus tasted like mashed fava beans with a dash of tahini...no flavor at all. I had asked my waitress if the ingredients has changed and she advised me that they have a new distributor and cut back the oil portion used to mix the hummus. If these changes are permanent, it appears my frequency in dining here will change. Pita Jungle, PLEASE go back to how you cooked things from the beginning!",2,0

Pita Jungle,"Middle Eastern, American (New), Restaurants, Mediterranean, Vegetarian, Greek","Pita Jungle is one of my all time favorite places to eat so needless to say, I am a regular at this particular location. I am a creature of habit so I tend to order the same thing a lot (delicious babaganoosh, lavosh pesto turkey wrap, grilled veggies, chicken..etc) but I must say that I have never been disappointed in anything I've eaten at Pita Jungle. The food is very fresh and they have plenty of healthy choices which is important to me. The portions are large so I can split a meal or bring home left overs. The prices are fantastic for the amount and quality of food that you get. The atmosphere at this Pita Jungle is fantastic. I am a huge fan of sitting on the porch by the lake! In addition to that, I love the fact that the employees are encouraged to truly be unique individuals in how they dress and express themselves. I appreciate the diversity and ability to feel totally comfortable with my surroundings. There is one server in particular (Bo) that I have really been impressed with. He (and the manager) have ensured that I have a positive experience with every visit. The service has always been outstanding as the employees and manager clearly care about customer service and make it their top priority.

Be sure to ask for the whole wheat pita, it's healthier and tastes way better. They also used to have an item called a ""medchilada"" same concept as an enchilada but way tastier, the portion is pretty large (I eat a lot so when I say it's huge, believe me) so I would suggest sharing it with someone. I always get it with tofu, tried it with meat but it just wasn't the same. Now although this is no longer on the menu, you can still order it. All you have to do is ask :)",5,1
Pita Jungle,"Middle Eastern, American (New), Restaurants, Mediterranean, Vegetarian, Greek",We decided to try a different PIta Jungle that we hardly ever go to. We waited to be seated and we arrived before another bigger group but was seated after them. She came out and verified that there were 2 of us but there was 6 of us. So she took back the wrong group and had to end up waiting a little longer. We were starving and with 3 kids. We were seated and ordered our food which arrived rather quickly. Our server was great and on top of things. I would return here because i love their food and that location isn't too bad.,4,1

Very fresh ingredients and large portions for a great price. I rarely if ever finish even half of my meal which gives me lunch for the next day. I've had ever appetizer and they are all solid. The nachos are a meal in itself. They have tons of vegetarian options for those that don't eat meat or folks like me that want a break from it every once in a while. We never pay more than $30 for 2 people and that includes two meals an appetizer and a couple of iced teas. The place is very laid back and attracts a wide range of characters. Someone forgot to tell them there is a recession, very busy during dinner time. The food always comes out quick though.

Be sure to order it crispy otherwise it can be kinda chewy (unless you like chewy, then order it however you want). I really dig the BBQ Chicken pizza but I think that they might have recently changed the sauce or something. It's tasted different to me the last time I went. If they haven't changed the sauce, then I *COULD* be loosing my mind. Either way, it didn't taste as good this time around. Just saying",3,0
"Pizza Picazzo, LLC","Restaurants, Pizza","THE ONLY REASON THIS PLACE EVEN GOT TWO STARS IS BECAUSE THE DRINKS WERE PRETTY GOOD!!! When in there for lunch today (Sunday) was pretty impressed with the decor and music... They were pretty busy inside (had a huge party of about 20 maybe) so it took awhile for our drink order to be taken (understandable) Drinks came... pretty good stuff My sister and I shared a Caesar Salad and Marg Pizza... Caesar Salad came out we began eating... I find a DEAD BUG in it. It took awhile for the waitress to come over for me to tell her what was in my salad... by that time our pizza had come out... I was TOO GROSSED OUT to even want to eat it. The manager (I am assuming... she never said who she was or gave a name) seemed shocked that we didn't want the pizza and proceeded to ask why we didn't want the pizza. I told her there was a bug in my salad and didn't want to eat anything anymore, and said she could go look at the DEAD BUG on my plate to see why I was grossed out. She left and came back to explain that their were no bugs in their kitchen, but that it was the type of bug that comes in the salad when it's shipped, but that they did wash the lettuce (obviously not well enough, I'm the customer why am I getting a lesson on eating when I've eaten countless salads in my life)... she never asked if there was anything else they could do or offer to buy a round of drinks, or offer for a free pizza on our next visit (nothing to try and help remedy the problem) AND we ordered another round of drinks and still waited more than what I believe should have been appropriate for a table that was unsatisfied with what was going on. We were then not followed up with by her, or even acknowledged again. In the end it's not the servers fault that this had happen, but being in the hospitality industry I understand what GOOD customer service is, and when you apparently don't care about a table... We were charged for everything, the waitress had to take the check back to take off salad and pizza. It is a shame the manager could care less about this event.. I'm normally VERY forgiving when stuff like this happens, but how the situation was handled infuriates me and I am very unhappy with my experience at this establishment. If your place is going to be busy with a big party, OVER STAFF!!! Have more than one person at the bar, and have one server taking care of the HUGE party.",2,0
"Pizza Picazzo, LLC","Restaurants, Pizza","I just started going back to Picazzo's after a hiatus (no reason, just hadn't happen to go for a long time). I love their new philosphy! They are really trying to focus on using organic and healthy ingredients and are implementing more green, sustainable practices - definitely love supporting that! I've had lunch there twice in the past month. We sat out on their nice covered patio (complete with misting fans and sunshades for when it heats up). The first time we each ordered their lunch special (a perfect hearty meal - 1 slice of pizza, a salad, and a drink for only $7.95). My favorite is the puttanesca slice (tomato, artichoke hearts, olives, feta), but make sure to ask what their slice of the day is. My favorite salads are the Chopped Italian, Pear Gorgonzola, or Spinach. Yesterday we ordered a small Diavola pizza (carmelized onions, roasted peppers, pepperoni, and spicy sausage) and the spinach salad. The diavola is one of my favorites - I'm a sucker for carmelized onions and roasted peppers and it has a little spice to it. My boyfriend loves the Organic Santa Cruz sparkling lemonade they offer there, so we usually order that (I also like their regular strawberry lemonade). They offer a great variety of menus items - appetizers, salads, pastas, pizzas, and more. They have a wide variety of crust options (including gluten-free), They also have a ""pizookie"" style pan cookie (a solid dessert, but nothing comes close to Oregano's). They have a good wine selection and bar too. With all of the selection, there is definitely something for everyone. Keep in mind this isn't Domino's or Papa John's. The pizzas run in the $15-23 range, but it's worth it! I'd definitely recommend Picazzos!",5,1
"Pizza Picazzo, LLC","Restaurants, Pizza","Went there for the gluten free menu items for my child. She got tired of rice. First of all, during the work day, the average person has approximately one hour lunch breaks, not one and a half, not two. One. It was 45 minutes before the waitress even took our order. I told her that i only had an hour lunch. She stated no problem. Ordered for my two children the gluten free pizza. Myself the Thai Chicken, my sister and her husband the Hawaiian pizza. 1/2 an hour later the waitress brings two of the pizzas and says she will be back with the third, the gluten free pizza for the kids (mind you they are 2 and 4). It never comes. So not only is my food getting cold but the kids cannot eat, and even if i could eat, not having the kids food means that no one gets to enjoy theirs. Call over the waitress who hands us our bill, and wants to charge us for the pizza we did not get. UM NO! Says that they cooked the wrong crust, and that she would bring it out for the kids to eat. Responded with ""No she has a gluten allergy"". Says she will have slices of the same out in 2 minutes. 10 minutes later, no slices. Call her over to ask, and ask for manager. Manager does not come over. I go to the front of the restaurant and ask for the manager. He is argumentative and combative about taking the pizza (which i still don't have) off the bill. WTF????? I mean seriously. His reasoning was that he gave us two slices instead (which by the way we did not order) and that we were offered the pizza with the wrong crust that we refused. Mind you FOOD ALLERGY! Is this guy a moron? I told him that under no circumstance was I going to pay for it. And if he had a problem I would be happy to talk to the owner. After 5 minutes of arguing, cold pizza for me and a $50 dollar food bill, i paid and left I would not recommend ever stepping foot in there.",1,0
"Pizza Picazzo, LLC","Restaurants, Pizza","I just got done reading all of the reviews. Wow! I must say that my experience with this restaurant is different then most people's. I have been here 3 times and if I am driving down to the Valley, I make it a point to try to eat here. I have only been here for lunch. On all 3 occasions, our service was excellent and the food was fresh and outstanding! We get the pizza, salad and drink lunch combo. Plenty of food for the price. I am guessing that the average consumer doesn't understand all that goes into the pricing at a restaurant. Not only do you have the cost of your overhead (rent and utlilities), but you have labor costs and food costs. If you are using fresh food (as Picazzo's does) the cost goes up. So if you like fresh food that doesn't come from a jar, box or can, then you have to pay the price. I for one and willing to spend an extra few bucks and know that I am getting fresh food prepared from scratch. I highly recommend Picazzo Pizza. Enjoy!",5,1
"Pizza Picazzo, LLC","Restaurants, Pizza","This was my second trip to Picazzo's. I went to one in Tempe when it first opened a few years ago. I don't remember much about it but I guess it couldn't have been too bad because I went back. This time, I went on a Thursday night at about 7:30 and the place was mostly dead. We were seated promptly on the patio per our request because the weather is finally tolerable outside. Our party of 3 ordered a cheap bottle of wine, the baked brie to start, a Caesar and a wedge salad, and a large thin crust pizza. Our small salads were HUGE but very very good. The large salads are probably as big as the table and could feed a small army. The baked brie was also very sizable but very good as well. The give you a bunch of flat bread, 2 roasted cloves of garlic and 2 melted chunks of brie. The pizza (1/2 peperoni, sausage and ricotta, and 1/2 pesto & artichoke) was also very tasty. I would definitely get the peperoni, sausage and ricotta pizza again. The next time I visit I would just get a salad and pizza to share. I didn't realize that the portions would be so ginormous. The salads, appetizer and pizza could have seriously fed around 5 people. I guess that is why they can get away with charging so much for their food. I see some issues with the service here on Yelp, but our waiter was very fast and friendly and I couldn't have asked for anyone better. I will definitely be back again. Oh, and this place is on restaurant.com so before you go you can buy a $25 or $50 gift certificate for just a couple bucks. It was well worth it for us and would do it again.",4,1
"Pizza Picazzo, LLC","Restaurants, Pizza","Yes,I see the negative reviews below, and agree that maybe the prices are a bit steep, but we had a splendid dining experience there on Friday evening. Picture this - in comes two rowdy kids and a couple of overheated parents and everything *could've* gone badly. But they didn't. Our waitress (7 mos. preggers!) could've been surly, but she was very helpful and friendly. The hostess brought out a couple of table toys (Barbie laptop, Etch-A-Sketch) to entertain our kids - it worked. My wife had to order from the gluten free menu, and there was no fuss at all from the waitress. She gave us time to order, they brought us bread at the table when we asked (for the kids) and didn't charge us. My wife order the salad which was huge and we split it deliciously. My ravioli with gorgonzola was excellent, the kids' Margherita pizza was yummy (though they didn't really like the tomatoes on top), and my wife's gluten-free eggplant meal was great. Sure the bill topped $60, and I tipped her nicely, so I wouldn't make this an every weekend place, but it certainly fit the tab on Friday night.",4,1

She actually told us to enjoy our meal, unfortunately she was already 10 feet away with her back to us when she said it. Wow...never felt that welcome before! The food (a small thin crust shrimp scampi pizza, a child's cheese pizza and a salad with chicken) took forever. And when it finally arrived, it was a whole lot less than satisfying. The salad was bland, with two pieces of chicken and 12 tons of lettuce. The child's pizza was okay, but how can you screw that one up, right? The scampi pizza was another story entirely. When you order a $15.00 pizza, you expect to maybe have a couple slices left over for tomorrow's lunch, right? Not at ol' Picazzo's! Here's a pic of the pathetic pie. FIFTEEN DOLLARS, ladies and gentlemen. That's $1 per shrimp! What a bargain!! I've had microwave pizzas you cook on that little gray paper box that were tastier and crisper.

I know the signs outside say they have award winning lunch specials and I hoped that extended into dinner, of course. First of all, $18 for a medium pizza (6 slices)!?!?! Damn. I figured it must be fantastic, and I thought ... what the hell. I got the Bourbon Street Pizza. It smelled awful the whole drive back to my hotel. So pungent and fowl, I immediately regretted my decision. Sure enough, 5 minutes later, it was one of the best tasting pizzas I've put in my mouth (deja vu for me). Credit goes out to the hand-tossed dough, and the quality of the ingredients. I liked it so much I went back two days later to get a Pesto Margerita pizza. It was just ok. For a fancy pizza, it was better than a chain pizzaria (sp?) could make it, but not as good as before. They did, however, make an Awshm tortilla enchilada soup, and their bread is great. I give them four stars because I don't live here, and the novelty of eating fancy schmancy pizza that's not called california pizza kitchen (I live in LA) was, well, a bit of a novelty. There were so many items on the menu I wanted to try that I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, even though their pizza is ridiculously expensive and smells awful (both time, what are the odds?).

As for which pizza to order, there is only one that is truly good. It is the QUATTRO FORMAGGI. Okay, okay, hang on, it is not like any quattro formaggi you would pick up at 1 am in North Caldwell, NJ. But let's be real, we are in Scottsdale, the fact that they put quatto formaggi on the menu without putting in brackets (4 cheese) so the many presbyterian woman would know what it meant is an accomplishment. Moreover, no one in Scottsdale is even out at 1 am. Those presbyterian women have to be in bed by 11, why does anyone need to be up at 1 am? This is a really good pizza. The combination of flavors is fabulous. It is dead on. There is the sweetness of the pears that mixes with the sharpness of the gorgonzola. It is the correct blend of flavors that mix in your mouth, dance on your taste buds and allow you to say that this pizza is alright. This is a good place to grab a pizza.",4,1

The pricing is fair for the setting. Would give a five star but for some reason they shut breakfast down at 11am, which is senseless and especially disappointing on Saturday and Sunday. It would be a 1 star for dinner. Very expensive to get poor service and ok food. I am glad I had a Groupon or I would have been very upset with the dinner.",4,1
Piñon Grill,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, American (New), Hotels, Restaurants","We live a few minutes' drive from Millennium McCormick, home of the Pinon Grill. We recommend it very highly. The entire facility is inviting, open, bright, and airy. The restaurant overlooks a beautiful, large covered patio by a lake with mountain views in the distance. The friendly hostess seated us at a table by a large window. Irma, our server, greeted us warmly and took our drink orders. My wife and I explored the breakfast menu as we sipped our coffee and tea. Ellen ordered what turned out to be amazing lemon ricotta pancakes with bacon. I ordered their loaded breakfast sandwich on toasted rye. It was superb! Irma checked on us during the meal with a highly professional touch, giving the Pinon Grill a special warm character. We plan to go back for more of their special brand of hospitality, good food, and relaxation.",4,1

I had the filet and the others had ribeye. Everyone was extremely happy with their food. The staff was attentive but not bothersome. If it was daylight the view would have been great.,5,1
Piñon Grill,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, American (New), Hotels, Restaurants",We had a Groupon for this restaurant. We sat outside in very comfortable chairs with a great view of the lake. Service was fantastic and it should have been as we might have been the only customers. So the beer was $6 a pint and food was expensive. A couple two OZ BBQ sliders were $9 and everything was ala carte. The specials would get you a nice steak for a nice price of $34. The food was good except for the nachos which appear to be a hold over from some cooking show. Really putting Pork Rinds on nacho's? Just ok which explained where all the customers were.,3,0

Wow, were we pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious, the prices were realistic, and Damon was a great waiter. My husband had the Halibut special, and loved it. I had the grilled salmon, also prepared perfectly and very flavorful. The sides were great. Loved the broccoli &a cauliflower with aioli. You can sit inside or on their huge patio. Overall a very enjoyable meal/experience.",5,1

Piñon Grill,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, American (New), Hotels, Restaurants","We had a pleasure of having a dinner there tonight. I've had a Groupon from there I needed to use so we went not expecting much. It was in McCormick Millennium Hotel in Scottsdale. The parking lot was almost empty and the restaurant was empty when we got there. Was seated right away and a friendly waitress told us about the specials as she gave us the menu and took drink orders. Everything on the menu sounded delicious and every thing we ordered came out beyond our expectation. The chicken was cooked perfectly with this delicious sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus as side dishes were wonderful. We had a lot of food yet still didn't come out to be the full amount of the Groupon so we took 2 desserts home for later. All in all, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend this restaurant even if you are not staying there. The view of the golf course was nice and the restaurant is very casual. Great service too.",5,1

We were warmly welcomed upon entry by the bartender Lamar, and our server Damon was excellent, being extremely attentive and knowledgable about the specials, how every item was cooked, and its origin. The view was also excellent, and they had a few good local beers on tap which wasn't necessarily expected for an upscale place in Scottsdale. Would definitely return.",5,1
Piñon Grill,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, American (New), Hotels, Restaurants",What a surprise this place was! We stayed at the hotel for an in-town vacation and intended on having quick appetizer before we went out for dinner. The lake views at night are incredible and the server was an expert in describing the dishes. My wife and I decided to stay for main courses and the halibut and steak was delicious. Our server offered to pair a wine with each course and our whole experience was surprisingly great! Highly recommend.,5,1

Piñon Grill,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, American (New), Hotels, Restaurants","Having lived in the Valley 25+ years, I'd come to the Pinon Grill 2-3 x a year, especially for special occasions or to bring out of town guests. The beautiful view of the lake, golf course, gorgeous flowers and good food made it a favorite. However, a month ago, a friend & I came to celebrate my B-day, but were SO disappointed at the dreastic menu change. No longer available were the great salads (Cobb), sandwiches or their specialty burger. Also gone were the chips with a spicy cream cheese spread, previously put on your table without charge as a welcome while you were seated. Now the menu is mostly Asian and a bit ""weird"". My friend ordered ""Sweet/Sour Chicken"" which looked like a McDonald's order of chicken nuggets with a gelatinous sauce on top. No rice - that was $4 X-tra! Even the fries for the expensive burger were X-tra as well. Our waiter, Jesus, was very attentive and efficient, but was upset at hearing all our negative comments about the new menu, especially when I said ""We were NEVER coming back again"". Of course it had nothing to do with him, just the sheer disappointment of how much this fine restaurant has changed. The views are still stunning & tranquil but can't make up for the ""weird"" menu.",1,0
Piñon Grill,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, American (New), Hotels, Restaurants","My mom and I ate here during our stay at the hotel and our experience with both has been the same: beautiful setting with mediocre service. Upon being seated for breakfast, it took us 25 minutes just to receive water and coffee. This included getting up to find a server since we didn't see anybody in the first ten minutes of being seated. Once we finally got our water, then our coffee, we waited another 10 minutes to receive the cream we asked for. The restaurant probably had about 10-12 tables occupied at the time, something the 3 servers working certainly should have been able to handle in a better manner. (The tables around us waited just as long to be greeted and receive drinks.) The food came within a more reasonable time frame and was average and what you'd expect of a hotel breakfast. If they upped their service level even just slightly, they'd offer a much better dining experience.",2,0

Look for it.",4,1
Piñon Grill,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, American (New), Hotels, Restaurants","We stayed at the hotel, so went here sheerly because of the convenience of location. Pretty room, and had it not been raining biblically, the outdoor seating would probably have been gorgeous. After about 5-7 minutes, the table (seated after us) had water and coffee. We...did not. After attempted flagging and eye contact, finally a server appeared. We ordered our breakfast, eggs Benedict and fresh berry waffle, two waters, a coffee, and a small OJ. They removed one of our two coffee cups, understandable. So I wanted the coffee, they took my cup. Fine, I took the mug left by the boy and put it by me. Several minutes later, coffee!!! The server poured the coffee, placed it by the boy. Odd. What, did he look more like he needed the coffee?? Anyway...the food. Fresh berry Belgium waffle, was just a waffle with an orange slice and one (1) raspberry. No whip? Com'on! Eggs bene... Decent. The hollandaise sauce had something different to it, but I still cleaned the plate. And the Sonoran potatoes...omg, delish. I could have eaten a whole plate of those! Either way...not the best experience. Terrible service. Just 'ok' food. For convenience staying at the hotel...just go have breakfast.",2,0

Although restaurant.com is a great opportunity for a restaurant to obtain new customers by showcasing its food, service and ambience, this restaurnat feel far short and I will not be returning. The dining room was closed due to a private party, but I was not told that when I made the reservation one hour prior. Therefore, we were seated in the bar. Very romantic---not! It had no atmosphere and was very cold; therefore, we had to wear our jackets during dinner. Waiter was not accommodating, not attentive and charged us an automatic 20% tip, despite the fact that restaurant.com coupon did not require that.",1,0
Piñon Grill,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, American (New), Hotels, Restaurants","We went there for breakfast as we've read about the $4 mimosas all day. The hostess asked us if we want to sit inside or outside on the deck. We said deck. Here's what we didn't know - the deck is part of another restaurant where there are no $4 mimosas :( . There are, however, $4 miniature glasses of regular orange juice, that on top of being pricey, just tasted bad like it was spoiled. Now for the good part: the lake view is splendid! (always wanted to use this word in a review - I always imagine it being said with a British accent). The service was high class. Tentative and luxurious. The food was good. Waffles were served with real maple syrup. Portions are not large (which was perfect for us). The whole menu is a little overpriced and I just feel that value for the money is not that great. I know there's a lake and it's in a ""resort"", but drop a few bucks from every dish, make the OJ freshly squeezed and I'd throw in 2 more stars.",2,0
Piñon Grill,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, American (New), Hotels, Restaurants","This place is really trying to be upscale, but it's not. To me an upscale place is where you can't afford to bring your little brats. First, the good. The staff was friendly and prompt. Refills kept on coming. I ate here for 6 meals over my 2 day stay at the resort and I never ordered the same dish twice just so I could try a variety. Here is a rundown of what I ate and the quality: -Chicken Quesadilla: So soggy it was falling apart, inedible -Arcioech (sp) Scallops: It's Arizona, there are no fresh scallops. They were overcooked and the seared spices were a soggy mess. The potatoes and Dijon dressing were great though. -Eggs Benedict: Very good, cooked perfectly. They do it a little different and give you smoked salmon instead of canadian bacon. Not a bad change but they were a little cheap on the quantity of salmon. -Matador Hamburger: Fantastic burger and they will cook it rare. If you order one well done, you shouldn't be allowed to review any red meat. -Center Cut Filet: Obviously not a prime cut. Perfectly cooked and seared. Veggies were also well seasoned and not overcooked. Good choice. -Salmon: Great seasoning, slightly overcooked and bizarre sauce with the consistency of pudding under the garnish. The sauce added nothing to the fish. -Creme Brulee: Very nicely done, maybe a little too much heat on the sugar, but still delish! -Caprese Salad: Tomatoes were flavorless and old (dried out appearance). Mozzarella was obviously a Costco purchase (not bad though). If I wasn't eating here for free, I would balk at it just for the prices let alone the mixed quality of the food. No hot waitresses here, but the server staff was great.",2,0
Piñon Grill,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, American (New), Hotels, Restaurants","Ugh, this place is just terrible. It tries to be high-end but has nothing going for it -- not even that view of the ugly fake lake. Definitely not worth the hefty price tag! We had a 6:30 reservation that night and they had already run out of the rib appetizer by the time we got there. When I ordered a salad and soup as an entree, they told me I shouldn't do it because the two plates ""wouldn't fit next to each other."" I persisted, and they made it seem like a huge inconvenience -- but when the plates came out, everything fit just fine. My mom's salad was wilted and my lobster chowder was bland with absolutely no taste. The salmon entree was dry and the carne ranchero annoyingly chewy. We really couldn't get out of here quickly enough, and ended up snacking in our hotel room afterwards!",1,0
Resto-Bar La Belle Province,"Restaurants, French","The staff at this place are incredibly cool. My brother and I went in to grab a bite after partying and we were kind of harassed by some random person and the staff entirely had our back. Once they realized we were uncomfortable, they went above and beyond to secure our comfort and safety. The food was rad, great casse croute, but the staff (front of house and kitchen) were super supportive and present. I have never, in my life, felt as safe at a late night diner as I did just now at this place. Honestly, the nicest two men I've ever met working a graveyard shift. Best dudes ever! It was madly appreciated.",5,1

Resto-Bar La Belle Province,"Restaurants, French","This is NOT a part of the Quebec chain of ""La Belle Province"" fast-food restaurants - apparently it's not possible to trademark ""The Beautiful Province"" in Quebec, which means ANY restaurant can be called that. It's still a fast-food restaurant, but definitely a step up from the chain. The burgers are tasty, and the poutine is really good - the gravy is not too runny, it's got lots of flavour, and the cheese curds are fresh. I haven't tried the chicken burger, but girlfriend wasn't a huge fan of it - so I'm sticking to the beef burgers. I've also been for breakfast too (on the weekends), and it's a solid. Typical Quebec breakfast of eggs, fruit, (really good) home fries, beans, and toast (and cheap for the portions you get). This is place is my go-to for hangover days, 'cause it's cheap and good. If you're in the area and need a fast feed, then I would recommend you go here.",4,1
Resto-Bar La Belle Province,"Restaurants, French","This is one odd little neighborhood diner. I'm not generally a fan of la belle province. I find their food to be slightly below average your typical diner food, and their prices tend to be relatively expensive. Fortunately, it doesn't seem to be very standardized between La Belle Province restaurants. I lived next to this little resto-bar for close to a year, and only recently (4 years later) came back for another meal and wrote this review. The restaurant has a small diner area up front, with 3 ""banquettes"" and a counter area with several bar stools. As you enter, you're faced with a large beer fridge and a wall covered with sheets of paper describing the various combo meals available. You order at the counter, pay, sit down and a waitress brings your food to you. Late on a random Sunday evening, we ordered the 2 hot-dog + Poutine meal, which after taxes and tip ended up being close to $10. Not too bad. The hotdogs were streams and had mustard, relish and sauerkraut. Perfect. The poutine was decent. Some of the fries weren't fully cooked, and the cheese weren't super fresh. You could tell it had been put in the fridge, which takes the squeakiness and the oiliness away. The sauce was your typical poutine-mix gravy. Nothing special. There might have been even a little too much of it, and it ended up being quite the mess at the bottom of it. The restaurant also doubles as a bar. You can have a beer for $3.25 (Dec 2009 visit) as you eat, or you can go in the tiny bar area at the bank and mingle with the bilingual crowd who watches football on a couple small TVs. Not a bad place, not stellar either. If you're in the area and are looking for a quick bite/drink on a late Sunday night (when most is closed in Verdun), Resto-Bar La Belle Province in Verdun should do the trick.",3,0

It is obvious the food is made with love here, and it is always reassuring to see the owner hard at work in the restaurant serving customers, not to mention cooking. Probably the only disappointing thing is that the last time we went their cheese curds were overly salty.

And love the drink selection found a huckleberry cream soda I drove 1200 miles to get last time!! New favorite!

Tomorrow for real.,5,1
Rocket Burger & Subs,"Sandwiches, Salad, Hot Dogs, Burgers, Restaurants",This burger joint is amazing... Very limited seating so be prepared to eat family style if necessary; it adds to the charm. The beverage choices are amazing and the prices are ridiculously cheap. It takes me almost an hour to get there from my house and they've never disappointed me.,5,1

Rocket Burger & Subs,"Sandwiches, Salad, Hot Dogs, Burgers, Restaurants","I stopped here with my four year old yesterday with a Groupon. We had lunch here. I had a gyro with fries; he had a hotdog and fries. The fries were simply amazing! Perfectly prepared and delicious. The gyro was done perfectly - not burnt or dry. The interior is nothing special - a tv, some chairs and tables. The people behind the counter are terrific. If you like soda, this is the place for you. They even had my home town favorite - FAYGO! Plenty of great energy drinks. The prices are reasonable. Stop by.........",5,1
Rocket Burger & Subs,"Sandwiches, Salad, Hot Dogs, Burgers, Restaurants",We LOVE this place!! Excellent food at reasonable prices!!! It is clean and the service is outstanding.

Rocket Burger & Subs,"Sandwiches, Salad, Hot Dogs, Burgers, Restaurants","I have dined twice for their sandwiches, and they are average at best. Haven't sampled their hot dogs or hamburgers yet, maybe that is their strong point. However, they have a HUGE selection of bottled pop. And they have FAYGO, in glass bottles made with cane sugar. Excellent! If you haven't had faygo go and try a bottle.",4,1
Rocket Burger & Subs,"Sandwiches, Salad, Hot Dogs, Burgers, Restaurants","When my fiance and I decided to go to Rocket Burger, I was extremely excited about it...she, being a vegetarian, was not. We got there, and I'll admit, from the outside looking in, and even once inside the door, I was a little put off. I wasn't sure I wanted to stay there and eat. All that changed once we got a good dose of the service (and food)! She ordered some pizza bread, with pretty much every non-meat topping available, and some cheese fries with no chili. I ordered a Chicago dog with chili fries (no cheese). We got a few drinks from their AMAZING soda selection. She got two of the original Dr. Peppers, and I got a Leninade. She ended up hating the Dr. Pepper because it used real sugar, and drank my Leninade...a taste of things to come once married I suspect. The pizza bread, according to her, was delicious. The fries, superb. My dog was amazing. I expected the actual hot dog to be a little bigger, but with all the things you get on the dog, it's a real meal. I ate that, and some of the fries (which were really really good...though I should have gotten the chili cheese fries instead of just chili) and was stuffed. The people that work there are very friendly. They brought the food to us rather than just calling out our names, offered to exchange the unopened Dr. Pepper for something different since she didn't care for it, and had good humor when my fiance made a joke about them not having veggieburgers. The only thing holding it back from being 5 stars is that the tables needed wiped off.",4,1
Rocket Burger & Subs,"Sandwiches, Salad, Hot Dogs, Burgers, Restaurants","It's a strange phenomenon that happens so very rarely, where something is redone, a song or movie for example, and ends up better than the source material -- *More Real Than The Original* ...Buffy the Vampire Slayer television show vs. movie ...Jimi Hendrix vs. Bob Dylan All Along The Watchtower (even Dylan admitted it was Jimi's song now) There is a restaurant concept sweeping the valley right now, based on a certain small number (between 1 and 3) of people of a certain philosophy (free-wheeling, nature-loving, noodly-music-listening) and their crazy atmosphere establishments full of odd ""paraphernalia"". Well, think about how one of those places got your hopes up and then left them dashed, and head on over to Rocket Burgers & Subs for everything you thought you'd get with those other guys: ~A fresh, clean, uncluttered atmosphere that you can sit comfortably inside of while enjoying your meal. ~A HUGE selection of almost any kind of soft drink you'd desire to quench that thirsty, dry mouth of yours. ~Lots of variety of menu, all with inexpensive good quality items of decent portion ~A radio playing the xmsirius Grateful Dead Channel for your soothing/stimulating dining pleasure. ~and a couple of really nice, friendly, hippy-on-the-inside-not-just-for-show restauranteurs eager to discuss their business and products, who are not only present now, but seem that they'll be sticking around to ensure the quality and value of their new place doesn't wane. The food is fresh, fast, and inexpensive. If you want burgers, subs, dogs, pizza-bread, gyro, salad, handmade fries & onion rings, PBJ with homemade jam -- they've got it. The chicken sandwich had a light crispy breading and a solid chunk of breast meat. The burger was a smaller patty (available as a double) but not dry, and the condiments were fresh and generous. For both sandwiches, the standout part was the fresh bun from Simply Bread (local). It was soft/firm enough to be just right, and had great flavor. They have a cooler chock full of interesting and bizarre selections from Pop The Soda Shop (Jones Soda, imported ginger ales and root beers, glass bottle real sugar sodas from mexico, dublin dr pepper, etc). My spicy Bleinheim Ginger Ale did not skimp on the ginger flavor! A couple of real ex hippies would do it like this -- no flashy superficial emphasis on outward appearances and gimmicks, just quality, freshness, and friendliness that is truly genuine and sincere. I feel like I made a new friend. Rocket Burgers & Subs is one out of this world place, and I'm glad it landed in my neighborhood.",5,1

Prices are reasonable and the food is GREAT! Steph and Dee remember what I like and don't like. Might be a little difficult to find at first as they are not in a storefront.

Smokin Thyme Kitchen,"Restaurants, Food Delivery Services, Burgers, Food, Sandwiches, Barbeque","Ordered tonight for delivery using DoorDash (by the way, they don't charge any delivery fee for the first month after you sign up with them!). This was my first time trying Smokin Thyme and it was OMG so fantastic! The burger was perfectly cooked and the toppings plentiful. I recommend trying the original (OG) sauce on it, as it was almost like a sweet barbecue that complemented the burger so well! The fries are hand cut and delicious. For dessert, I ordered the French Quarter doughnuts with cinnamon and powdered sugar, and they were amazing! Give this place a try... you will NOT be disappointed!",5,1

The guys working were nice enough, but they didn't say anything about the burger happy hour (we saw a sign on the window after we had ordered burgers and paid for them...I don't think they were discounted) and they didn't give us our drinks until after we had our food and asked for them. The 'cajun' beer battered fries were atrocious. No seasoning or flavor and tasted like soap and old oil. The regular fries were fine and the burger was ok but a little well done for my taste--they didn't ask us how we'd like them cooked. I definitely won't be back and you should go elsewhere if you want a restaurant experience. The place also seemed kind of dirty--the tables were sticky and the floor was slippery. Sad.",1,0

Smokin Thyme Kitchen,"Restaurants, Food Delivery Services, Burgers, Food, Sandwiches, Barbeque","We gave Smokin Thyme two shots. Both times, good service and good burgers. BUT both times... the order has been messed up (even when it was written down on paper and given to them.) I can forgive that, but I can't believe the hush puppies and fries that we just got. The oil has to be beyond bad. The hush puppies were completely charred and black, and left an awful after taste. The fries had the same disgusting odor, and old burnt oil flavor. I've heard about old oil here before, from reviews and an article. I figured that after that, it would be something that they were very wary of and keeping an eye on. I'm very sad that I fed this to my parents. :( I just got done bragging about all the good food places around here... and now they think I'm a sham.",1,0
Smokin Thyme Kitchen,"Restaurants, Food Delivery Services, Burgers, Food, Sandwiches, Barbeque","My wife and I love Smokin Thyme Kitchen! The owner, his wife, and staff are super-friendly, and they deliver delicious food. We have had the brisket sandwich, the pulled turkey sandwich (three times), the burger (two times), the beignets, the Cajun fries, and their Nicaraguan coleslaw (two times). All of the items are outstanding, but our favorites are the burger, the pulled turkey sandwich, and the coleslaw. The burger comes with free bacon, lettuce, tomato, jalapenos, and some other toppings for one flat rate of only $3.50. The toppings are large and very fresh. The pulled turkey sandwich really melts in your mouth. I would recommend adding the Carolina sauce to this sandwich for extra flavor, but you can still eat it without the sauce and still love it. Lastly, we really enjoy the Nicaraguan coleslaw because it is so unique. For example, it does not have a mayo base to it. Also, it just has a very good homemade taste. If you are looking for some really good food that is inexpensive and made with a lot of love, then you must check out Smokin Thyme Kitchen. We will be back there again before the summer is over.",5,1

I was able to put any toppings I wanted with no charge and they had a plethora of sauces to choose from! The fries were great and the burger was awesome! I was amazed when my bill was only $5.00? That's unheard of, so I had to go ahead and try the handmade sorbet! Absolutely GREAT! If your ever in the area, I suggest stopping in and trying them out!! The staff was also super friendly, they even gave my dog a ""to go"" container with some smoked turkey in it! Lastly I'll add..... the friend that I met there tonight is the biggest food critic I know of, and he's already called me raving about it, planning on grabbing lunch there often!",5,1
Smokin Thyme Kitchen,"Restaurants, Food Delivery Services, Burgers, Food, Sandwiches, Barbeque","Burgers are freakin' awesome and huge- especially for the price! We had the mac-n-cheese balls and the fried pickles, fries, and my youngest had a corndog (hand dipped and fried- looked delicious). You can't beat the prices here and for from-scratch food. Big plus: Bacon added to the burgers for FREE (ya know, like no charge?!?!?!). Crazy... Only complaint, and certainly wouldn't keep us from coming back, is that it was way hot in the place. We were very warm, but not enough to send us running to the door, we ate there. I would suggest just some portable fans in the dining area with the glass up on the screen door, it would move the air around and create a breeze. Super nice staff, the lady with the blond hair and Foo Fighters tee shirt was so nice. We will be back when we come up to Cleveland again, we need a place like this in Columbus (Hilliard area?

Smokin Thyme Kitchen,"Restaurants, Food Delivery Services, Burgers, Food, Sandwiches, Barbeque","Super awesome place. Nice and small, friendly staff and the burgers are insane. Super cheap.

However I have a feeling we just got a bad batch because everything else was really great.",5,1
Smokin Thyme Kitchen,"Restaurants, Food Delivery Services, Burgers, Food, Sandwiches, Barbeque","The wife and I headed up to try the burgers as we had heard they were good and prices were cheap. We ordered a Bacon mushroom jalapeño cheeseburger, a Mayo mushroom cheeseburger, a smoked turkey sandwich, beer battered Cajun fries, and mac and cheese balls. First thing I can say is the cheeseburgers are $3.50 flat with any toppings you want and whichever sauces you want. The cheeseburgers are descent. If I was in the area I would stop and get one, but I wouldn't drive very far to go there specifically for something to eat. The smoked turkey sandwich was very tender and moist, but had way too much seasoning ( salt and pepper, especially the pepper) and no real smoke flavor at all. The beer battered Cajun fries are really wedges with way too much batter that tasted like old fryer oil and the potato portion was gummy not flaky. The mac and cheese balls really tasted bad as still the old fryer oil flavor along with some processed flavor. The coating on these is similar to a hush puppy consistency not a normal batter or breadcrumb type, kind of weird. The place is simple asthetically, but it works for what it is, and the people behind the counter seemed very nice. If you live in the area, it is fine for a descent cheap cheeseburger, but I wouldn't recommend the sides other than maybe french fries and hope the oil in the deep fryer is fresh.",3,0
Smokin Thyme Kitchen,"Restaurants, Food Delivery Services, Burgers, Food, Sandwiches, Barbeque",Literally sitting in here now trying not to throw up. The food is well within its value range. The burger was unseasoned and less than appealing. The fries were under done and the Mac and cheese balls were the worst I've ever had. The food has the strangest aroma ever.

My first visit was today and I tried a cheese burger, with an extra patty. I also added bacon, and grilled onions which of course I expected to be charged for, but upon checking out I was told ""toppings are included"". The burger on an extra soft bun was fantastic. In addition to the standard ketchup, they also offer a number of flavored BBQ sauces. I opted for the root beer version, that had just the right amount of sweet and spice to it. Service was exceptionally accommodating. I called my order in and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I asked if they could push that back a bit and was greeted with ""of course, just tell us when you would like it ready"". My burger was just coming off the grill as I arrived. Great food, wonderful, friendly service,, and an excellent bargain. Run, don't walk to get there.",5,1

We ordered both the Cinnamon and the Powdered sugar. The presentation was spot on. They were perfectly coated with their toppings, freshly made and still very warm.

Solasta,"Vegan, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Restaurants, Gluten-Free, Food","This restaurant is the epitome of what a vegan restaurant should be; excellent service, impeccable food, wonderful chef, and brilliant decor. When it comes to food quality and taste, this restaurant competes with the very best vegan spots in Toronto. Some highlights: 1. black bean burger with the Gouda cheese. Please do yourself a favour and add the (coconut based) Gouda cheese. The taste is EXPLOSIVE! It's the perfect compliment to the bean burger. 2. The tacos. The tacos were presented beautifully! Very much of finesse. The cucumber relish gives it a nice sweet taste, but you get that kick from a couple slivers of hot pepper. Very well balanced dish! 3. The smoked tomato soup is a MUST have. 4. The brownie is a loaf style brownie, but is wonderfully crafted; even has flax in it! Topped with a coconut cream chia pudding and chocolate pudding gnash, and gooseberries on top. Again, very well balanced dessert. All in all, was a fabulous experience, and I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.",5,1
Solasta,"Vegan, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Restaurants, Gluten-Free, Food","So excited to try this new west end vegan restaurant with my friends for a bday treat. We all started with the special potato soup with corn bread that had kale and fennel. Both were delicious! The soup was thick and creamy and the corn bread was a dry, crumbly texture and it was a great start to the meal. Friend 1 ordered the tacos filled with purple yams on a soft corn tortilla.....very nice flavour. Friend 2 ordered the cauliflower and spinach dish which had a nice lemony flavour. I ordered the chickpea crepe which was filled with broccoli and cabbage I believe. It was cooked just right and tasted wonderful. The cauliflower dish and chickpea crepe came with a side salad which had a nice light vinaigrette, but part way through I noticed a hair in the salad. I would have assumed it was my hair but it was in the salad, not on it, so I couldn't be sure. My friend had the special pumpkin cheesecake for dessert which she enjoyed. It had a light, somewhat granular texture....not smooth or creamy, but very tasty. Unfortunately, we found a 2""piece of fuzz in it. I ordered the oat and maple butter tart which tasted horrible.....I had my friends taste it to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds and they agreed. I told the chef/owner and he took it back, tasted it and agreed. He said he tried a new vegan margarine and that resulted in the poor taste. He threw them all out. We ordered 2gf choc chip cookies instead and I enjoyed it. It def tasted gf so my son would not like it but I really enjoyed it. When the bill arrived, we were not charged for any of the dessert items and we were all given cards to return for a discounted meal. The place is cute and small with a few tables to eat in and packaged items to take out. The food was presented well and the staff were friendly. I will go back as anyone can make a mistake, but they took the proper measures to make up for it.",4,1

Star Ginger,"Vietnamese, Restaurants, Salad, Asian Fusion","One of the worse fast food experience I've tasted as far as an Asian grill goes. I don't even want to waste too much time on this review since I wasted enough time eating at this place. The staff seemed bitter and careless just how their food was. If you do decide to eat at this place I'll tell you what not to order. First off I wanted to try a different dish but I had to settle with a third option, since the first two they were out of. I requested Teriyaki chicken since it was the only edible looking dish they had to offer (I was wrong about that), with a side of white rice. The teriyaki chicken had a bad flavor and bad texture that I didn't know if it went bad or it is how they prepared it. I took several bites but was afraid to continue any further because I was afraid how I would feel afterwards. Overall, I will never return to this place nor I would recommend it to anyone else. There are other places literally next to each other that would be a better option.",1,0
Star Ginger,"Vietnamese, Restaurants, Salad, Asian Fusion",I decided to try them for dinner on Saturday @ 5pm while spending the weekend at Wild Horse Pass. I ordered the green curry chicken with noodles and was told they were out of noodle. It's not like they had a big rush on noodles because there was no one in line ahead or behind me. I had to have it with white rice which was dry and no flavor. The man took my order was also bland and no personality. I will skip Star Ginger on my next trip!,2,0
Star Ginger,"Vietnamese, Restaurants, Salad, Asian Fusion","Were staycationing at Wild Horse Pass Casino, and after a day poolside, I decided Pho from the Food Court sounded like a good idea. I was wrong! Went with the chicken Pho, the broth had no body, the noodles were limp, and the chicken was dried out and awful. Plenty of basil, jalapeño and typical accompaniments could not save this. He got Banh Mi which he enjoyed, Green Curry Chicken appeared to have the same flavorless, dry chicken as my Pho, and abysmal looking spring rolls and potstickers. Would not return, and I've been officially banned from choosing food after daydranking ;) Thankfully, it was a comped meal.",2,0
Star Ginger,"Vietnamese, Restaurants, Salad, Asian Fusion","I don't know how many people have given this place 5 stars but I am going to. I had the Tofu Pho tonight and it was delicious. I couldn't believe the number of pieces of tofu they gave me, but even more incredible was the broth. A very good broth infused with star anise flavor. Noodles, bean sprouts, jalapeño slices, fresh basil, and lime all added to this amazing broth made my trip to this casino well worth it. So if you can't win at the tables, try a table at Star Ginger and eat any of the Phos they offer (chicken, beef and tofu) and you will be indeed a winner. Saw the mongolian beef which looked amazing. I will try that out next time. A 5 star rating for a food court spot in a casino? You Betcha!",5,1
Star Ginger,"Vietnamese, Restaurants, Salad, Asian Fusion",I don't know what-the-pho the person who gave this place 4 stars was thinking....they must have been drunk and high. Not even close to the real thing. Kind of disappointing after waiting a really long time. They have multiple burners and only one pot of water going....doesn't make sense in a fast paced environment to cripple your line by doing one single plate at a time. Asked for hoisen and soy sauce...I was told they were out.....really???,2,0
Star Ginger,"Vietnamese, Restaurants, Salad, Asian Fusion","We orders the Spicy Thai noodles with chicken. When presented to us, the dish consisted of a large bowl of what appeared to be soup along with undercooked vegetables and small bites of chicken. The taste of ginger permeated this bowl of dreck. I think I could have gotten a better meal from the floor of a stadium after a game.",1,0
Star Ginger,"Vietnamese, Restaurants, Salad, Asian Fusion","Pho? At a casino food court? Do I dare? These questions (All valid ones to ask when you're hungry and craving something soup-like) floated through my head as I pondered over the menu at Star Ginger. As it turns out, Star Ginger serves up a decent bowl of pho, for $7. You have your choice of beef or chicken, and it is made to order as soon as you pay for your meal at the cashier. The pho was a sizable portion in a large bowl. I chose chicken, and there were a lot of white meat chicken chunks in the bowl, as well as freshly shredded onion, pho noodles, and cilantro. The broth was rich and a little unctuous, and there was a plate of fresh basil, bean sprouts, and lime wedge on the side. They also included a disposable soup spoon and a small container of sriracha and hoisin sauce. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity of this meal. They did a decent job with the pho dish, and if I were at this food court again, I definitely wouldn't mind trying another bowl of pho!",4,1
Star Ginger,"Vietnamese, Restaurants, Salad, Asian Fusion","Excellent Beef Pho. The beef broth was flavorful and for $7.00 the bowl was large enough for two, except you'll want your own. The only downside is that Star Ginger is in the casino food court. For us it was crowded and the tables dirty. They do have takeout though.....",5,1
Star Ginger,"Vietnamese, Restaurants, Salad, Asian Fusion","I will be back again. The Pho was delicious! I ordered the tofu and vegetable pho which was made to order.

Star Ginger,"Vietnamese, Restaurants, Salad, Asian Fusion","I had some take outs from the casino location but was very disappointed. My shrimp curry plate had 3 little shrimps and the salad on the side had a very little dressing. The noodle salad that was prepared ahead was very mushy.

Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","This was my husband and my time trying Korean food, but based on this restaurant we are big fans! He had the Bibimbap, and I had the Dan Dan noodles. Everything was delicious!

Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","When a friend recommended this place I wanted to suggest somewhere else right off the bat - but, she was in town visiting from out of state and had heard about this place somehow so I figured I had better just agree, since this isn't somewhere she can come to anytime. I was nervous I wouldn't find anything on the menu that I liked and I didn't know what to expect. Well, I was definitely able to find plenty of delicious food and drink, and overall I was very satisfied with this place! We ordered the Brussels spouts to start. They were SO GOOD! I ordered the Miso Ramen. I was very pleased with the flavor fullness of this dish. I don't do mushrooms so I asked for it without and that was no problem. I would order this again for sure, it was delicious! My friends ordered the Dan Dan and Khai Soi. The Dan Dan was very good! Nice rich flavor. I love a good peanut sauce. I didn't try the Khao Soi as I am not keen on super spicy things, but my friend who ordered it said it was great. We also ordered some specialty cocktails that were all delicious and very pretty! I went with the Pineapple Express Mail. Dangerously delicious!",4,1
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","Food was good (but not the best Ramen in Madison) but the service was TERRIBLE! We had to flag down a server because ours never came to check on us and after an hour of waiting for our food and watching all the people around us (who arrived after us) finish their food, we thought it was odd we were still waiting. Our waitress finally came after we asked another server to go get her and then she said the order never went in and retook our order. We then waited another 20 minutes before it came out. Meanwhile, we had to flag down people to ask for water refills. I'm not one to ever complain (it makes me super uncomfortable), but this service was beyond unacceptable. We weren't rude about the mishap but our server continued to avoid our table the rest of the night and it wasn't until we asked to speak to a manager after our bill came that she even offered to do anything to make up for the terrible experience.",1,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","Great experience!! Fast service, clean, located right next to festival foods. We ordered fried calamari - with spicy sauce, pork ribs with Korean bbq sauce, and pork dumplings. Now first about the good stuff! Loved the fried calamari and pork ribs very well made and appropriate spice/hotness level. I would suggest for people who cannot handle spicy food to not order this dish as the heat might be a little over powering for the palette. The dumplings were no big deal, the outer dough of the dumpling was very thick and the pork fell right out of the dumpling when I tried to eat it. Those dumplings stickers could be make a thinner. The pork ribs were my favorite, i recently checked the menu again and found out that they don't have those ribs on their menu anymore, I hope they get it back soon! Will definitely recommend this place, can't wait to try their new menu items! Will update my review after my next visit.",5,1
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles",Placed a business dinner reservation for 12 people on for a Tuesday via phone and they confirmed my reservation.

Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","This place seemed nice and pretty cool. It's very clean and the decor is cool. The seating seemed spaced apart and there was plenty of room. Service was quite slow... with 4-5 guys in the kitchen area, it was still pretty slow. There were only 10 people and the menu wasn't too big at night... so, I'm not sure... it took a while to cook noodles I guess. The wonton cheese sticks were good and the sauce was good too! I was excited! I thought my noodle dishes were going to be amazing. Omg... the broth was so bland. I had to ask for soy sauce just so I could at least have some flavour besides water and spice. I ordered the Veggie Ramen and my date ordered the Spring Ramen... I guess his was extremely fishy and bland as well. If any of you have been to Ha Long Bay for their Pho, that my friends, is flavour or if you'd made some of your own Top Ramen, that my friends... is flavour. These noodle dishes could use some sodium.... honestly, I think the team should maybe reevaluate the flavour of their dishes. Presentation was nice, but it didn't have the flavour to back it up.",2,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles",Dont go here if you want to try korean. Food is far from what korean food is supposed to be. I dont buy the fusion stuff either. I ordered jap chae and the noodles came out soggy and over cooked. Wonder what they were trying to fuse it with such that even the noodles did not come out right. Big disappointment.,2,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","I finally got a chance to check out this place with my wife. We had high hopes for Sujeo. We ordered the following dishes: Farmer John's Cheese Curds, Cheesy Ddeokbooki, and Shio Raman. Below is our opinion of the dishes that we've tried: Farmer John's Cheese Curds: The waitress told us to put the kimchi on the cheese curd and dip it in the sauce to enjoy the play of flavors. We thought the mesh of flavors were overwhelming and did not work together. The flavors were overly sharp and bitter. The cheese curds, however, were of good quality and tasted best by itself, even though it had a bitter aftertaste (kind of odd). Cheesy Ddeokbooki: We weren't sure what this dish was supposed to be. To be fair, we've never had traditonal Ddeokbooki, but the cheese didn't work with the dish. The wife thought that there was also not enough cheese to be called cheesy. We both agree that the dish was a little messy and lacked substance. Shio Raman: The best part of the raman was the pork belly (yum). Other than that, the broth was too fishy and I didn't care for the semi-wavy noodles. This is definitely not your usual shio raman. I also prefer Graze's raman (same owner). The broth is not fishy and felt more fulfilling. Overall, we didn't enjoy our dishes because the flavors didn't work. The menu also appeared to be overpriced. $18 for bibimbop? $15 for Japchae? We may come back to try other dishes, but don't recommend the dishes we've tried.",2,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","Got dinner here with a group of friends, 5 people got the chicken or pork belly ramen. This restaurant needs to improve their ramen. Everyone needed to add salt to the weak and flavorless broth. The egg had no flavor, and the pork belly was very tough and also flavorless. The hot sauce on the table was very weak, and soy sauce is only available upon request. I believe there are some good menu items here, but definitely skip the ramen if you come here!",2,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","Service was very good ... but menu choices? Seriously, does everything have to have bacon or pork in it. I am not a vegetarian, but don't eat pork and I'm not a fan of restaurants where I have only one or two menu items to choose from ... it certainly dissuades me from going back. I imagine vegetarians will have similar concerns.",2,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","Dined here last night with a group of 5. Took away one star for service. Service was not the best, we had to flag down our waiter a few times for more cocktails and drinks, and less than knowledgable about the beers and food. Another star taken away because the ramen was not good. It did not seem like the broth cooked for very long. The broth had no flavor to it and was very watery. It literally taste like water with fat in it. Not creamy or flavorful like it should be. Took away another star because the atmosphere was just strange. Not a cool hip-vibe like we were expecting. Also, They charge 18 bucks for Bibimbap which is crazy. I got it with steak and I had to search for the steak in the bowl, only a few tiny pieces of steak. Only good things were the cocktails and beer. We drank the Thai chili infused tequila cocktails and they were delicious. Will not be coming back.",2,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","Would be a solid 4 star but the music selection (rap - like, recent rap) pushes it up to a 5. Nice to have a late night place in Madison that feels like it could be in a real city. Make sure you at least split an order of the KBC - I have wet dreams about that stuff.",5,1
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles",Had dinner here with some friends. The menu is definitely eclectic. I had a 'Black Manhattan' for a cocktail which was pretty decent and the General Tso's Chicken Livers just because it seemed like something I'd never see somewhere else. The flavor was good and the textures weren't an issue for me because I enjoy sweetbreads generally. I'm not sure I'd order it again though because it didn't transcend the General Tso's we are all so familiar with from every takeout place ever. But the atmosphere was good and the chef seems daring. I'll go again.,3,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles",I love Graze (their sister establishment ) but I do not love Sujeo. It seemed to me that Sujeo is trying too hard in crafting their menu. There are some dishes on their menu like general tso chicken liver that do not 'fuse' perfectly. My first visit wasn't pleasant either. I ordered a bowl of seafood noodles and 3 out of the few mussels/clams were closed! Even though I am not a chef I know that closed mussels/clams are dead and you do not serve them to paying customers.,2,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","I was really excited about the prospect of this pan-Asian restaurant by Tory Miller. However, like his other restaurants, Graze and Etoile, it's a bit hit or miss. The wonderful items on the menu are fantastic: Jjamppong seafood noodles had an amazing broth and the refreshing frozen custard -- these were elevated to a high art. However, they also make the disappointing dishes just that much more disheartening: Congee tasted and looked like a lumpy oatmeal -- inedible, a plate of mostly breading with a touch of squid masquerading as ""salt and pepper squid."" Also, the inexplicable: good fried chicken, but priced at $18? Make sure you read the reviews carefully and opt for the right items to get great meal while avoiding the bad.",3,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","Sujeo is lackluster. I've been here several times and have tried more than a dozen dishes and most of it was disappointing. I did like the tongue salad and the crispy Thai egg, both delicious. KBC was tasty, but lacking in Korean influence. Otherwise, the richness of the chicken livers and really all of their rice dishes are not balanced out (I say this as someone who likes rich food). I'm picky about noodle dishes, but I thought maybe Sujeo would change my mind. I tried the Shio ramen and was not impressed. Suejo is a trendy joint and you might very well have a good time here, but I wouldn't seek it out for its food.",3,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","Very underwhelming experience, especially considering the price. I am fine with a long wait time, if the food is worth it. In this case, it wasn't. My boyfriend and I were both pretty disappointed.",2,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","I ate here with some girlfriends on a Thursday night. We didn't have to wait long and the wait allowed us to look over the cocktail menu. Usually Korean restaurants don't serve craft cocktails so offering them is a plus! There was only one bartender who was busy helping the party of 4 while we were mostly ignored. But we quickly got called to our table and ordered drinks that way. I had the mango tequila cocktail and the chai one. The mango one was good but could have been spicier. So, order it. Extra spicy! The chai one tasted like someone spiked my chai tea in a ""that's really different"" tasting kind of way. I probably wouldn't order that again. For eating, we shared the chili eggplant appetizer and squid. The squid was just normal deep fried calamari. It was just fine. The eggplant was pretty good and came sprinkled with Thai Basi and tofu. I really enjoyed it. For dinner, I shared a bibimbap with the spicy sauce on the side (a recommendation from our server, which ended up being a great recommendation because then we could also use the sauce on the table n addition to what it came with). This was pretty good but when you live in a large metro area with tons of amazing Korean food, this Madison bibimbap was just a but sub par to what I've had before. So based on the other reviews of this place, the food was decent, drinks made this experience better and the service was attentive. Im not sure if it's worth an hour wait but if you haven't ever tried Korean, it's probably the place to go. I would also recommend this as a good first date place. It's not loud and you get to be adventurous with your food order and again, the cocktails. The only other thing I'll mention is they have ""fancy"" silver-looking chopsticks. Whatever they are made out of makes using chopsticks even more difficult, so I asked for their regular takeout chopsticks that made me feel less clumsy.",3,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","I went here for dinner last night for the first time with some friends. I have honestly been going in and out of the apartment complex that this restaurant is attached to for months now and every time I gawk over how amazing it smells going past this restaurant. So finally a groups of friends and I decided it was time to try it. We went around 7pm on a week night so we had no issues getting a table and I assume it is like that most nights of the week, but as it goes in Madison, the weekends inevitably bring on long waits. When we arrived we were greeted by a perfectly sweet hostess and server that continued to give us fabulous service throughout the meal, checking up on us frequently and giving us more than enough suggestions on what to enjoy on the menu. Each meal was presented with a little guideline about how best to eat it from the cooking staff such as stirring up the bipmbap and noddle dishes because they are layered at first. But I thought this was a lovely touch to their service that clearly showed they wanted you to enjoy your dish as much as possible. I wish I could've tried some of the appetizers like the pork buns or the potstickers because I watched them come out of the kitchen throughout the meal and they smelled/looked fantastic. So if you get the chance to go there I certainly recommend coming with a big appetite so that you can try as much as possible. My friends and I all got separate dishes that looked absolutely fantastic. I went with the bipmbap with spicy tofu, although you get choices of meat to go in if you would rather have those, my choices were beef and pork, but I was feeling the tofu so it wouldn't be too heavy of a dish. When you're given the bipmbap you're warned that the dish it is served in is piping hot and not to touch it (you should definitely listen to that). One thing I love about the bipmbap dish is the crispy rice that comes at the bottom, and when you're given your food here the rice isn't actually crispy yet, you're supposed to let the rice sit on the sides of the bowl to crisp. So even though they tell you to mix up your dish throughout the meal in order to keep the food hot, you actually aren't going to get any of the crispness if you push around the rice off the sides of the bowl. Additionally, bipbmap always comes with an egg on top (another reason why I am obsessed with this meal), but when they serve it to you the egg isn't fully cooked, but is placed on the side of the bowl so that it continues to cook and supposedly as you stir your food around the egg will cook more. I am going to be honest and say I am not sure my egg cooked all the way through, which is slightly concerning, and I feel like it would be better if they cooked the egg a little more so you wouldn't have to worry about eating a raw egg. So although there are a few iffy portions of this dish I ate almost all of it because it was so delicious. The spicy sauce that the meat is covered in is very spicy, but also the perfect blend of spices that you honestly can't stop eating. I highly recommend this dish, but just beware of the crispy rice/egg concerns. All in all, this place had wonderful service and fabulous food. I know some reviews haven't been all that great, but if you're looking for Asian fusion in Madison I think this is most definitely your best bet.",4,1
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","As much flavor and life as a frozen PF Chang meal. Might as well just get one of those and save your money. At least then you know the level of mediocre you're getting and spend proportionally. The Shio Ramen has the blandest broth I've ever had accompanying ramen. A mildly fishy water with noodles, some mediocre pork belly and an egg. No body, no depth. The KBC might as well be called KFC with rice and ketchup. Oh and bland kimchi too. The Dan Dan is basically spaghetti with generic ""Asian"" spices. Ragu with chili and sesame oil anyone? The BBQ Pan Fry Noodle might have been worth it if half the meat hadn't been grisly and inedible. Sujeo is a step up if your baseline is Americanized stripmall Chinese. Otherwise it's basic and boring and tries so hard to be as flavorlessly Asian as possible so as not to offend anyone's tastebuds that it's actively infuriating.",1,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","I've got to say-I had high hopes for this place, especially since it was coming from Tory Miller, but man was I disappointed. My first time here was a week or two after it had opened. I ordered the japchae. It was okay, but not great. I knew from the beginning that Sujeo was going for a more local farm to table type of deal and would use more local ingredients as opposed to authentic Asian ingredients. I fully support the idea of using local ingredients! My first experience was a three star, but not bad enough to keep me from coming back. My SECOND time was a COMPLETE NIGHTMARE! (I'm sorry to say this, because I really did hope this place had such potential) i got FOOD POISONING!!! I ordered the Bun Cha noodle dish from the noodle bar last week with the Thai sausage. The noodle dish was extremely salty and I should have been more reserved with the dressing I guess. However, I was so hungry I ate it all-including all of the sausage. After the meal, I had a pretty bad stomach ache, but thought it was because I ate so much. The next morning was like pure hell. I woke up super early and felt like I was going to die. It took me five days to recover fully-I was finally able to eat food on the third day. I will not be heading back there. Tory Miller, you're other places are great, but this one is definitely not of the same caliber. I also heard from a friend that her coworker also got really sick after eating here. I don't know what that person ate though... The only reason why I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because I like they're cocktails. They have great cocktail names.",2,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","A group of 5 of us came here specifically for Dim Sum service after hearing about Sujeo from a friend. We had to wait one hour for our table. Typically, this is good for a business since it means they are busy/making money. They have a good system of texting you when your table is ready so we were able to go elsewhere during our wait. Upon getting seated, we were presented with a dim sum cart and then we got 2 cups of water for our group of 5. Normally, each person gets their own cup of water. The server informed us that each bamboo container of food costs $5. After we chose a few dishes, we finished each dish and proceeded to wait until the next cart came around. This took half an hour, only now when they came, we were then informed that dim sum cart service has stopped and it was provided on an order basis. We were allowed time to see what we wanted to order...and when we ordered, we waited another hour for the food. When I went to the restroom during this time, I heard one of the waiters inform the woman who seemed to be running the floor that dim sum cart service was back on per the chefs request. At the end of our hour-long wait, the food still did not arrive and we decided to leave and just pay for what we already ate. In addition to this, the wait staff/hostess seemed disinterested and unprepared. Waters were not refilled the entire time we were there and staff members seemed to be getting a lot of questions about the lack of cart service from other patrons. Even the woman who appeared to run the floor was speaking to the wait staff with increased volume. Positive things: we were not charged anything for our dissatisfaction. The interior is very nice and has a nice upscale feeling to it. The realization that they do not specialize in ONLY Dim Sum service; we will have to try their non-Dim Sum dining service to get the full picture. To be honest, this restaurant caters to Caucasian Americans who enjoy hyping up Asian-style food service and cuisine with disposable income. For the Dim Sum service, there is a lot to be learned and improved upon.",1,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","Interesting dishes and great flavors are the backbone of this restaurant. Our appetizer of salt and pepper squid was nicely seasoned but the crispy chili mayo was just ok. Their homemade kimchi and various picked vegetables were amazing with the rice and grilled steak sliders ""Ssam"". My wife and I shared the dish and had plenty left over. My only disappointment was that the strip steak was not the best cut and had a lot of tough fat on it. The flavor was spot on though and the salt and black and white sesame seeds were a great topping. They have interesting drinks as well. A cool place to try if you are looking for something different.",4,1
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","Whereas Sujeo does seem from one vantage point to be ""Korean Fusion"" cuisine, it seems infinitely closer to ""Pan Asian""; while some of their dishes do seem to be decisively ""Korean"" in nature (of course with some foreign elements), a lot of their other offerings don't seem ""Korean"" or contain any Korean elements at all. Semantics aside, the above sentiment doesn't quite change the fact that Sujeo offers a new dimension to Madison's already growing and diverse restaurant game; a friend of mine who works at Epic and I decided to come here after having breakfast at Graze (whose owner, Tory Miller, also happens to be the brain child of Sujeo) and being so impressed by the food that we decided we need more. Besides the fact that everything we ordered that evening did not requite the restaurant's namesake utensil (sujeo == spoon in Korean), the meal was pretty excellent: Appetizer Salad (now replaced by Kohlrabi Salad) Very nice mix of heirloom tomatoes with other organic greens, with chicken innards mixed in, topped with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and other spices. I'm shocked that this is no longer on the menu. Whole Fried Fish I forget what the fish was that evening, but it was crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, garnished with tangy and somewhat spicy sauce all around the fish. Khao Soi The first Khao Soi I've tried that come with an entire chicken drumstick, not removed from bone! The curry-broth was point on, the crispy noodles were brilliant. The restaurant wasn't as mind-blowing as we hoped it to be, but it was still a solid choice -- oh, and the next person that keeps professing the hypothetical existence of ""Tonkatsu ramen"" (Tonkatsu == amalgamation of Japanese ""ton"" which means pig/pork and english ""cutlet""; Tonkotsu == Ton [pig/pork] + Kotsu [bone]) needs to be hunted down by a lynch mob.",4,1
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","Check out all my reviews at theglobeonmyplate.blogspot.com Sujeo is Tori Miller's newest enterprise after the success of L'Etoile and Graze. He is letting his Asian pride fly in his newest venture. Graze has long had some Korean flavor throughout the locally sourced menu: Bibimbap, a Korean stone bowl cooked rice dish, and Kimchi gracing it's Ruben for a garlic-y spice kick. Sujeo is a complete departure into Pan-Asian flavors. All created with local fresh and extremely high quality ingredients. Chef Miller is straying into some seriously deep Asian waters for the Cuisine at Sujeo. With a single visit to Sujeo with a few dining companions we visited China, Vietnam, Korea, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and Sri Lanka. Chef Miller has cherry picked some of the best dishes from the wide Asian World and made them his own. Each dish is well prepared, using the highest quality ingredients from around Wisconsin and the US. Each dish has been refined to the point of culinary masturbation. Can great food be so rich and flavorful that it makes you feel dirty? Imperial roll The imperial rolls were a ground pork and shrimp roll. Shrimp and pork are commonly mixed together in Vietnamese and Cantonese cooking to make the most flavorful and interesting fillings for dumplings. This is a rice paper wrapped spring roll which has been deep fried. Salt and Pepper Squid This is an interesting take on Salt and pepper seafood Chinese dishes. Generally a whole shell on shrimp or crab is lightly breaded with five spice and black pepper. The R&G lounge in San Francisco is famous for their Salt and pepper Crab. It's a strange dish in that the breading is stuck to inedible shells, but in the process of cracking and extracting the meat you get bits of crunchy peppery goodness in every bite. Madison's new Asian Sweet Bakery on Park street makes a Salt and Pepper Shrimp tasty enough to eat shell and all. Obviously Squid does not have a shell but the light and peppery breading is similar to other salt and pepper Chinese dishes. Chili Crab is a dish I've only seen in Singapore. It's one of the specialties of that region. In Singapore and Malaysia a chili sauce thickened with eggs is liberally doused over a screamingly fresh crab from Sri Lanka. The mythology surrounding these Sri Lanka crabs is that they grow big and fat in the Bay of Bengal feasting on the outpouring from the Ganges river, a holy river in India which is used as a cremation and burial ground. They say it is this which makes Sri Lanka crabs the best in the world. Nom Nom Nom Chef Tori has decided instead of using the ""one-step from cannibalism"" (delicious BTW) crab to using West Coast Dungeness crab. A very tasty and more local substitute. The Chili sauce it came with was honestly better then some of the best places in Singapore. Sweet, salty, spicy, this dish really hits on all cylinders. Spicy Red Curry with long beans, pickled ginger and crispy shallots. I was expecting a Thai style curry. But boy was I wrong. This was much less balanced then a thai Curry light on spiciness and heavy on sweetness. The closest thing I have had to a curry like this is an Indonesian pork curry often served in a rijstaffel meal. Pork Rendang is one of my favorite dishes around the world and one which is nearly impossible to find outside of either Southeast Asia or The Netherlands. The only thing lacking in this dish was the spicy :( Their Ramen was absolutely killer. The first few bites were overwhelmingly ginger flavored but that quickly mellowed out with the strong deep flavor of the sea. To me it tasted very strongly of crab roe, ginger, and pork fat. It was absolutely a unique (in my experience) and amazing bowl of Ramen. It was so complex it was almost confusing, but in the end was addictively good. The KBC chicken served with a bevy of Banchan (little picked sides in Korean cuisine) is at once a very American dish and a very Asian one. Steaks, hamburgers, apple pie, Asian people know what these dishes are and might have had them before, but the ubiquity of KFC in Asia is of epic proportions. Fried chicken has become an Asian staple. They even have knock-off KFC's in a lot of the Asian world! One of my dining companions called the curry ""Dusky"", and it's a perfect description for that dish. The flavors are deep, sweet, salty, and they taste of the depths of dark Soy Umami. The perfect blend of sweet soy and caramelized protein. That characterizes all of the food at Sujeo. Deeply flavorful, joyously seasoned and only perfectly describable in terms that have nothing to do with food. Check out all my reviews at theglobeonmyplate.blogspot.com",5,1
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","Had the banchan (7 different kinds of pickles with flavorful kimchi jjigae soup). Both the pickles and the soup were top notch. I'm a pickle fanatic and have had a hard time finding quality asian pickles in Madison. These were A++ pickles! Only odd thing was the inclusion of the macaroni salad. Ddeokbokki was super fresh tasting, rice cake was chewy/delicious (it is harder than you would think to find a good rice noodle) and the fish cake was slightly sweet in a well spiced sauce. Chili-braised eggplant was interesting, in a light chili sauce with basil, very innovative. Mango curry was thick, not traditional Thai-tasting, did not appear to have a large amount of coconut milk. The highlight of the curry was the mango, which cut through the other spices in a bright, pleasant way. There were also these curious, thin, crunchy unknown vegetables, and squash. I had hedged on ordering it because Madison does not lack for good Thai restaurants, but I am pleased, because it was great and set itself apart from its contemporaries. We ended the meal with chocolate and strawberry custard, the milk is from Sassy Cow. The custard had nice flavor (as in, it tasted like strawberries and not artificial) and had a slightly grainy texture. I am already planning out my meal for next visit, which might be this week. I have found my favorite restaurant in Madison.",5,1

Excellent service on a busy Saturday night as well. There are lots of daily specials but so many it might make sense for the restaurant to print them out as it took our waitress about 4 minutes to explain them all. And it can be noisy so it can be hard to hear everything. We found the atmosphere to be a little spartan and underwhelming however. But we did score one of the corner 4-tops which made our dining experience a bit cozier.",4,1
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles","We stopped in to the noodle bar for a late lunch but walked out minutes later. The hip hop music was blaring and we made two requests that it be turned quieter. An employee finally turned it down a bit, but not so much that we couldn't hear the f-bombs coming out of the speakers overhead. We were the only customers so the staff member was clearly saying that his listening preferences were more important than creating a pleasant environment for us.",1,0
Sujeo,"Korean, Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Noodles",This place is completely overrated. It's a Korean infused Noodles & Company at best. It blows my mind to hear that people are waiting almost 2 hours to eat here. Don't waste your time and money. Madison has way better to offer.,1,0
Thai Home,"Thai, Restaurants","It's a nice little spot, looks beautiful inside. Lunch special $11.99 was great. You pick any dish (beef, chicken ), noodles or rice, soup or mango salad, and spring rolls. The food was very tasty, coconut soup was excellent. Pad Thai was very good. Tons of chicken pieces. I almost wish it was less chicken and more noodles. However, after a few bites, I realized why it was so tasty. Salt. Everything was too salty. So that's why -1 star. Our table could tell it wasn't authentic Thai and Malaysian but the meal was good nonetheless. Yes I would come back again, maybe would ask if they would use less salt.",4,1
Thai Home,"Thai, Restaurants",I recently visited Toronto and looking for a nice restaurant to take out. It was late night. I found out this place in yelp. Ordered Malay shrimp gravy and red curry. Malay curry was delicious and not too spicy. It was on point. I would definitely recommend this one from the menu.,5,1
Thai Home,"Thai, Restaurants","Ordered delivery using Foodora so can't speak about their in-restaurant service.

Thai Home,"Thai, Restaurants","Got delivery, so not sure about service/restaurant atmosphere. Ordered online through their website, delivery was prompt; food was delivered nice and hot. We ordered roti, mango chicken, curry pad Thai and brown rice with peanut sauce. All dishes were delicious - flavourful and fresh.

We will be ordering again and would recommend.",5,1

I ordered through Foodora so I can't comment on the in-restaurant service, but everything about my meal was fantastic. I was starving, so I ordered the coconut soup, vegetable pad thai and a side of coconut rice. Everything was still nice and warm, very flavourful and the portions are VERY generous! I've had enough for lunch, dinner and I still have some leftover for a light lunch and dinner tomorrow. Overall, I would highly recommend Thai Home for some delicious thai food if you're feeling under the weather (or not) and looking for great value for your money.",5,1

Thai Home,"Thai, Restaurants","Waited over an hour for delivery through Uber eats. Had high hopes but food fell flat. We are huge pad Thai lovers and have tried it all over the city and throughout Thailand. This pad Thai was very sub par. Dry noodles and artificial taste. Definitely no tamarind flavour and I could swear I could taste that undesirable ketchup taste :( Mango salad, fried rice and spring rolls were good. Pad Thai is simple and should be fool proof with good high quality ingredients, but they missed the mark on it here unfortunately.",2,0

All with a homestyle feeling... in the sense that everything looks, feels, and tastes like it's prepped with care. Highly recommend without a doubt.",5,1

Complete crap.",1,0

They were all fabulous, and this place isn't stingy with the spice or the portion sizes. A lovely lunch bonus.",4,1

Thai Home,"Thai, Restaurants",Came here with 5 other friends for a Civic Holiday dinner at 7pm. Restaurant was about 30% full. Staff was friendly and food started coming out around 15 mins after ordering. I got the coconut mango chicken ($13.99) which was good. Sauce was a bit too strong; the rice helped in diluting it. The mangos tasted alright but wish they were more soft. Was able to try my friends dishes and they were good too. All dishes were full of colour and portions were decent size. Best dish I sampled was the Oodles of noodles.,4,1
Thai Home,"Thai, Restaurants","I can't comment on the restaurant as I ordered delivery from here last night. The portions were large and the food, for the most part, was very good. We had: Mango chicken - 4/5 Pad thai - 4/5 sweet and sour beef - 2/5 Green curry with chicken - 4/5 spring rolls 3/5 coconut rice - 1/5 way too sweet for me! The price is slightly higher than other thai delivery I've had. Our order came to $77 with the $3 delivery charge, but I feel it was worth it as the food was definitely better quality than most. The chicken was thick pieces of white meat in all the dishes but the pad thai, where it was shredded. One slight annoyance was that they offer a free pad thai for orders over $50 and when I tried to redeem the coupon I was told on the phone that the minimum order had changed to $60 but the coupon was still for $50 on the menu they sent with the order... I would definitely order from here again!",4,1

Thai Home,"Thai, Restaurants","I have no idea why anyone would give this place a high rating - but those high ratings ruined my Mother's Day dinner! For delivery, we ordered crispy tofu with peanut sauce, chicken satay (peanut sauce), avocado chicken, a beef and chili salad, sticky rice, and a spicy chicken dish I forget the name of. The peanut sauce was water and sugar, with a tiny amount of peanut butter in it. Sure, water and sugar are cheaper than peanut butter -- but really? It was horrible. The fried tofu was not the beautiful puffy crispy tofu you get from other places, but skinny triangles coated with bread crumbs and burned in oil. It went in the garbage, along with the peanut sauce. Next, the description of the beef and chili salad said it was thin slices of beef with mint, cilantro, and chili. Nope. It was nearly raw, inedible beef, in a soupy cabbage, red pepper, scallion, cucumber, and tomato base. I am allergic to tomatoes. I hadn't said that, which is my fault - but tomatoes were not listed in the ingredients, and hardly any of the things that were listed were actually IN the ""salad."" To the garbage bin with that, too. I was left with only chicken satay. It was okay -- until I bit into a piece of chicken still raw in the center. This place is not only awful - it's a health hazard. Never again!!",1,0
Thai Home,"Thai, Restaurants","Solid food, great service, clean and open late. As far as I'm concerned, this place was a real find. After a double shift, my friend and I wanted to grab something on the way home. We figured we would try it and I'm really glad we did: this could easily become our Go To for Thai in this neighbourhood. The service was good, even though we were just getting take out. She even gave us a promotional discount, which was kind. The restroom was clean and modern (I like the latter but insist in the former). The whole place smelled like fresh cooking, and it was nice that the quiet wasn't interrupted by TV. As we waited for food, I couldn't help but notice a steady stream of takeout leaving the kitchen. That's impressive, considering it was after 10pm on a Tuesday. We waited less than 10 minutes, and it was still hot when we got it home. Despite the 10 minute drive, the shrimp were perfectly cooked. I got the curry Pad Thai and it was the first version I've had in ages that had a great curry aroma to it. And the portion was huge! I would definitely recommend this dish to anyone. Next time, I'm going to try the beef with roti. You should, too!",4,1
Thai Home,"Thai, Restaurants","We dined here and it took too long for our food to come, about 40 minutes, which you wouldn't expect from a casual Thai place. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and only had about 3 tables at the time. When our food came, it was cold. We sent it back to be heated up but when they brought it out again it was still cold, and didn't taste very fresh. Overall the quality was poor. We were disappointed because we came one time before for take out and the food was tasty and fresh. However it still took 40 minutes for our take out to be ready which is way too long. We won't be returning here. Consistency in food and service quality is very important.",2,0
Thai Home,"Thai, Restaurants","Don't go to any other Thai place in the Roncesvalles/High Park area, go to this one. My bf and I eat here 1-2 times a week and it's very consistent, always fresh, amazing flavors. We always get an order of vegetable coconut soup with our entrees along with roti and/or coconut rice. Every curry they serve is fantastic ESPECIALLY Malay. I can't even explain the party in my mouth when I dip roti into the curry sauce and eat it. The prices are good and so are the portion sizes. They also have good alcohol prices, so this place is a win all around. It beats that yuppy Thai place downtown ANY DAY ALL DAY.",5,1
Thai Home,"Thai, Restaurants","I ordered their Devil Fish tonight for takeout and I'm really impressed! The perfect balance of sweet and spicy. I did ask for the dish ""a little bit less spicey than normal"", so be warned. It definitely had a kick, but nothing too crazy. The fish had a nice light crispy batter, and the veggies were very fresh. Great portion size. I'm excited to try some of the other dishes. Give it a try Roncey! -- Update 1: I've been twice more and this place keeps impressing me! Second round of takeout was for lunch for 5 people this past weekend. I was happy to find on their takeout menu that they have really reasonable lunch specials which are also available on the weekend. We got a chicken pad thai, which was really good. It had a bit of a curry flavor to it, which makes me want to try their curry pad thai. I still prefer a khao san road / sukhai thai pad thai, but this was a pretty close second. A mixed market vegetable dish which was good, but i wouldn't recommend it unless you love tofu. And an amazing Coconut Mango Chicken dish. A must try! Around $35 including tax and the 5 of us couldn't finish it all. I just went again for my 3rd visit. The daily special was Malay Curry Beef with Roti. Wow!! Absolutely amazing! Delicious thinly sliced well marinated beef, eggplant, potato and that curry sauce, sooooo goood! I could have done without the tomatoes, but they did kind of work in the dish, so i can't fault them for it. The roti was amazing, and reminded me more of a chapati. I don't I had anything that delicious when I visited Kuala Lumpur. Rating holds. 5 stars!",5,1

It was bland as f*** Like seriously guys, just throw in some garlic and butter and parsley, and a squeeze of lemon and you're good to go. When was the last time you even tasted your food?

We ordered some apps which were okay but decided not to stay for dinner because we were sitting with empty drinks for 15 minutes.

We used to go to the location on Esplanade 5 years ago when we lived nearby. We had great memories of the Congo mussels and dipping the bread in the sauce was divine! But this time around, it was a disaster. We ordered the French Onion Soup ($9), Calamari ($13), Mussels + Frites ($22) and Summer Nights $7 (a blend of fruity beers or something). The best thing was (OBVIOUSLY) the beer concoction. The French Onion Soup was disgustingly sour, wreaked a bit of ""this has been sitting for days"" and had hardly ANY CHEESE. Sadness settled at that point. The calamari was crispy. That is all. But then the mussels.. The mussels we had high expectations for but they came out almost cold and the meat was tiny and shrivelled up. We had it sent back and received a ""fresh"" batch but the only real difference was it was hot. Our server was great but the food was so beyond awful. I looked over to the other table and noticed they hadn't ordered any food, but just drank beer. Wise people. Come for the interesting drinks but NOT THE FOOD. Save your money and spend it elsewhere.

I came here with some coworkers one evening and sat at one of their tables inside as outside was full (awesome patio though)... I saw on the table that on ___day (can't remember what day of the week we went) they had a beer tasting. There were 6 shot glasses on some metal thing with a flier saying that that day you could try their seasonal beers. No time limit, no exceptions listed, just stated that on every ___day they would do this... I asked the server about it, she picked it up, looked at it and said, oh, that's only till like 5 or something, completely dismissive. I didn't appreciate that since again, it said nowhere on there that it was limited in any way. Oh well We ordered some wings and poutine as an appetizer and some beers. The beers were all very good and when we finally got the wings, they were good too, artfully displayed, but not many of them. The poutine never came. Finally we got our meals, almost 45 minutes later. Two people got burgers and fries and I ordered the cheeseburger sliders. Honestly no one was very happy with their meal except the person who ordered wings. The burgers were overcooked and the buns were fairly tasteless. We had to request the checks because the servers didn't come back to the table (it was not a crowded night either)... we saw that the poutine was in fact on our receipt.

It was around 3 pm and the place wasn't busy; our server came over promptly and took our drink order. Looking good. But not so, for they arrived an eternity later. We ordered the mini burgers and the wings to share. The food also took a decade to show. The burgers were okay I guess, but the wings were a big disappointment. Eight measly wings for $15. The homemade sauce just tasted like Franks Red Hot which I like but it's mighty unhomemade. And the wings had a sprinkling of black sesame seeds on them which had a bitter flavour. And getting the bill, let's just say it was a Christmas miracle. Our server was in absentia so long I thought we'd have to wait until 2014.

The Bier Markt,"Restaurants, Nightlife, Canadian (New), Beer, Wine & Spirits, Food, Belgian, Bars, Gastropubs","Some context for my harsh feelings towards 'Bier Markt': Okay - I am really into beer and being new to the city, I prodded around for bars in Toronto that would be to my liking. Bier Markt came up often. Hell - it came pretty highly recommended on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer. So expectation were high... ... but it's just a yuppie beer (yes - ""BEER"" not 'bier') bar. With that said, the patio is sufficiently nice and the service was quite courteous. If you like drinking overpriced bottled Belgian beer, this place is alright. But is not a craft beer joint for the following reasons: TAP SELECTION: Maybe I came at the wrong time the draught selection was sorely lacking. The taps selection was comparable to any run-of-the-mill dive bar. Maybe it's just me - but I am only interested in draught selection. I can easily source and buy rare bottles and enjoy it at home. If you're used to joints with a 25+ craft brew rotation, Bier Markt is not for you. Let me put it this way - I had two pints and asked for the bill. I had already had everything else they had on tap -- and I didn't like any of it. We walked down the street to Bar Hop for our beer fix. IMPORT-MANIA: As soon as I saw that they listed the beer by country (they also boast about having beer from 24 countries), I should have just left. I hate any place that does this. When I lived in Japan, I routinely saw nice bars that featured bottles of Budweiser and Coors on display. Yup - Bud and Coors. Why? Because morons think ""beer from further away"" = ""better beer"". Now apply this reasoning to Stella Artois, Czechvar, Heineken, Beck's, etc... do people honestly not realize they are drinking swill just because it's imported? There are some fine Belgian brews available - but lot of European trash beers too. I know they don't have these in the GTA, but if you've been to a Fogg N' Suds (they are all over the place in Vancouver) -- Bier Markt is basically a Fogg N' Suds with 'yuppie guido' set to maximum... actually, the Fogg N' Suds chain has a better brew selection.

I had to open up the flame to heat it up, but it didn't really help, especially because the potatoes were cold and I mean ice cold. I don't really care for potatoes in the fondue but since they were there we ate them. Oh and the bread was OK but not superb. We ended up dunking the potatoes in the fondue pot and leaving them there for a while, sorry for the bad manners, so that they warm up and become edible.

Okay, I will give them the benefit of the doubt, let's see this time... and yes, it was lukewarm again, tasted bland, and the potatoes were cold again, and another friend said that her fries on the side were also cold, so I suppose that's written in their manual to serve the potatoes cold.

We weren't 'feeling' Beerbistro at King/Yonge so we decided to relocate to King/Bathurst. The Bier Markt on the Esplanade is often the BM of choice so we decided to check out their other location. It's a lot smaller, but it seems to be more of a place to go out. The Esplanade location seems to have more of a 'dining in' vibe. No cover. Check. Live band playing covers of hits from bands like The Beatles, Oasis. Check. Wide variety of beers to choose from. Check. Great service. Check. Food service. Check. A solid five stars.",5,1
The Bier Markt,"Restaurants, Nightlife, Canadian (New), Beer, Wine & Spirits, Food, Belgian, Bars, Gastropubs","Don't go to the Bier Markt. They are bullshit when it comes to bringing in innocent cupcakes to celebrate someone's birthday. They went as far as saying that we may ""poison people"" around us with the cupcakes. The GM guarded us at the entrance making sure NOTHING comes in. We were forced to go outside to eat. What's stopping me from giving these cupcakes to the people in line? The management would keep coming back to our table to make sure we weren't sneaking in any cupcakes. Their service is so slow. Their menu's gone down hill and they FORCE you to choose from fixed menus if you have a party size of 15+. I originally booked for 20 but since the pre-fixed menus were garbage I was forced to reduce my invites to eat from their normal menu. They would try and squeeze in my group so they can accommodate other. If you do go, go for the beer but not for the food. If you can, pass this on to all the people you can. I'm super bitter about their bullshit and want to bring them down.",1,0
The Bier Markt,"Restaurants, Nightlife, Canadian (New), Beer, Wine & Spirits, Food, Belgian, Bars, Gastropubs","One crazy Friday night around Midnight, after my salsa partners got bored of the dance floor in Scarborough and after a couple of drinks, we decided to join their friends at Bier Markt downtown Toronto. I've never been to Bier Markt before, even though I've walked passed it many times, so I was keen on checking it out. (Actually, to be honest, I didn't remember that I'd seen it before and thus I didn't know it was a bar, I thought it was a night beer market festival at the Distillery District, like those Asian night markets that happen once a year. And since I'm not a beer drinker, no one can blame me for not knowing that it's a bar!) When we finally arrived at the Bier Markt at around 1AM, I shocked to see a bar SO packed. (The bar was probably close to reaching its capacity limit.) Although it was very dark and loud on the inside, there was still an upscale European feel to it, meaning it wasn't ghetto at all. (Which is perfect for me!) The bar serves a trendy older crowd, -most people were just a tad older than me and came off as young professionals. (Very much like the crowd at Mill Street Brewery in the Distillery District.) As the name may hint, the bar has a wide selection of beers from all around the world. Although it carries your typical domestic beer, like Molson Canadian, it didn't carry the only beer that I'd ever finished a pint of: the Mill Street Organic, which was very disappointing to me. So I spent the night sipping my friend's Stella. Since the bar was so crowded on the inside, my party and I took it to the patio where we enjoyed each other's company over alot of beers with a serving of second hand smoke from adjacent tables. Despite the second hand smoke, I had a great time chatting it up with my friends and making new friends on the patio. Good weather, good company, good conversations, good drinks, all at a trendy King Street West setting, what more can one ask for?",3,0

I meant POURING! Thank goodness for our new friends in line with umbrellas. Too bad they were tiny umbrellas. I swear the door-woman has a hatred for people. It was POURING rain, and she wouldn't let anyone in, even tho' there was hardly anyone inside. I understand the pretense of keeping a line outside ... blah, blah, blah ... but SERIOUSLY, move the F'N line! Did I mention how wet I was getting standing in that line? But, I digress... It was strangely upscale inside but totally cool. The beer selection was incredible, I never thought I'd see so many beers on tap. The crowd was eclectic ... a little of everyone, mostly drunk but who could blame them. Expensive beer tho', ranges from $8 to $10, but worth every penny. Put down that Blue and give it a go! I never did see a food menu, but I'm hoping there's alot of wurst on there. Mmmm ... nothing like beer and sausage.",4,1
The Bier Markt,"Restaurants, Nightlife, Canadian (New), Beer, Wine & Spirits, Food, Belgian, Bars, Gastropubs","When the King St. Bier Markt opened up, I thought it would be tough for them to one-up their currently established digs on the Esplanade, but they managed to quite well with a cool combination of atmosphere and beer. The downstairs vibe is much more pub-ish then the club feel of their other spot. The place gets just as packed come 10pm on a Friday, but doesn't feel as hectic and sweaty. The clientele is a bit more grown-up and tame, which makes for a more pleasant drinking experience. Also rad for a quick bite for lunch.",4,1

The Bier Markt,"Restaurants, Nightlife, Canadian (New), Beer, Wine & Spirits, Food, Belgian, Bars, Gastropubs","I thoroughly enjoy this place. Pretty good food, nice selection of drinks, varieties of beer and wine. and verrrry courteous service. make a reservation if you want dinner, or just call ahead to see how long the wait is. but even if you have to wait there is a nice bar that is just as enjoyable to sit around and wait for your table. There are a number of people loitering by the bar while the other half sits and eats and that scnene continues all night long. Great for late night dinner and drinks before you go out for later night things. the selection of food and drninks isnt' AS good as beer bistro, but it is still good and typically priced for the area and type of establishment. good music, not modern stuff, just nicely done covers of top 40s stuff that you will appreciate of you are anywhere from 25-40. the age range in that place hovers around there too.",4,1
The Bier Markt,"Restaurants, Nightlife, Canadian (New), Beer, Wine & Spirits, Food, Belgian, Bars, Gastropubs","I haven't been to The Esplanade in a long time. (The Esplanade, by the way is the name of the street where you'll find the Bier Markt, and it is also, notably the name of this little trendy village). Located just south of Front Street, within walking distance of Union Station and Yonge Street, The Bier Markt is a very large and multi-purpose restaurant that is known for it's many beers and live music. I haven't been in a long time because the Bier Markt, while impressive for the world-array of beers, ales, and lagers, isn't anything to really travel your way out-of to go to. It's ok; it's clean and nice inside. The music is usually a good live band that brings the crowd on to the dance floor at night. But, that's about it. I felt it was like a pick-up bar and that whole scene is pretty tired. I would recommend going to the Bier Markt for their beers. It's fun to try something you've never had before, and for that reason alone, the Bier Markt is a neat place to go with a group of friends and have a drink fest.",3,0
The Bier Markt,"Restaurants, Nightlife, Canadian (New), Beer, Wine & Spirits, Food, Belgian, Bars, Gastropubs","A restaurant that turns into a bar later in the evening. Bier Markt is a new, clean ornate and sterile place. This space reminds me of the giant brew pubs you run into in the suburbs of Americana, except this one isn't surrounded by a huge parking lot just down the divided highway from the mall. Bier Markt does have a terrific selection of biers/beers from around the globe on tap, really good Belgiums, Germans, Framboise's, they even have Brooklyn (hoe!) Lager. The crowd at Bier Market is well dressed and good looking upper 20s into 30s. We weren't there for very long, but this place seemed like a pick-up bar. Our expedition did find that a breed similar to the American Cougar can indeed be found as far North as Toronto. Apparently, this species is more versatile than originally believed. Attempts to control the spread of this dangerous predator have not been successful. Beware or happy hunting! Although, more pretentious and with more attitude than other places we visited, patrons of Bier Markt were still friendly. There wasn't a cover when we got there, but when we left an hour later there was a line 40 deep waiting to get in. Live entertainment at Bier Markt at 9:00 on a Saturday consisted of a cover band. Prior to their set, the deejay was killing me spinning a set of 90s Top 40 that included that SWV song that sampled Michael Jackson's Human Nature and that cherry cherry cola song by Savage Garden. I'd never been so happy to see a cover band take the stage just to get that deejay away from his laptop. The mega-bar isn't really my type of place, but given how club-centric downtown Toronto is, this place wasn't that bad for the older crowd. At least they've got lots of tasty beer.",2,0

Even though they have bags that are food-grade BPA, whatever, there are still huge amounts of garbage generated for each table. However, I'm not sure if they have an alternative serving style to resort to. I love the sauce they put on their seafood and the way they cook it is simply scrumptious.

The only thing that gives it a minus is the really overpriced drinks. In conclusion, I would definitely come back again tho.",5,1
The Captain's Boil,"Seafood, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, Cajun/Creole","We decided to try this place after a few of my friends recommended it and all I can say is WOW. If you are looking for a fun experience and some really tasty food, I definitely recommend this place. We arrived around 6 PM on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was about 1/2 full. We were greeted and seated right away. My boyfriend and I had never attended before so our server explained the menu and process to us and took our drink order. The restaurant was tastefully decorated, everything was clean and tidy. They call the servers ""pirates"" which I think was playful and fun. The menus were very easy to understand, giving you a three step process of choosing your seafood. The seafood is seasonal, so some of the options may not always be available. They also have a chicken option if you don't like seafood. Then you choose your sauce and then your spice level. I ordered the lobster with garlic sauce and no spice. My boyfriend ordered the chicken with the captains boil sauce and our friend ordered snow crab legs with the captains boil sauce. She also ordered oysters, and my boyfriend and I got garlic bread. The seafood was to die for. The sauce was amazing. The lobster and crab were cooked perfectly. My boyfriends chicken was delicious. When you eat, you do not get a plate. The food comes in a bag with what sauce you ordered, you get a pair of plastic gloves, a bib and pair of nut crackers and you go to town. It was a really different experience. After you are finished, you throw all your left overs in a can on the table. There is a sink station in the middle of the restaurant where you can go wash your hands off if you got dirty, which you will. All in all, I had a very positive experience. For 5 oysters, garlic bread, three meals, 5 beers and dessert our total came to 145.00. The service was great, the food was great. We will defiantly be returning.",5,1

Tip: get garlic bread to sop up the amazing Captains Boil sauce mix - which is a combination of garlic butter, lemon pepper, and Cajun. We had lobster, snow crabs, oysters, clams, and shrimp.

The staff was always checking up on us yet our food took three times as long to come I watched two tables who came after me and a large group get their food before my table of three even got a cup of water. Once the food came it was extremely hot temperature wise and the captain boil flavour was just the right amount of spice. We ordered mussels crab legs shrimp lobster and Cajun rice. The Cajun rice is a popular choice highly recommend.,4,1

Kids thought food in bag idea was fun, I was grateful for the plastic bib and gloves as dinner can get a bit messy! Highly recommend mussels and clams, both served in garlic sauce - very yummy and mussels were huge. Fried shrimp basket and fried calamari were great. Sizzling plate combo of fish teriyaki, not so good. Fish was over cooked and chewy. Also recommend Cajun seafood rice as everyone loved it and it was spiced just right (and it was served on an actual plate with a real spoon!). Biggest problem I had with restaurant was that it said bags food are served in are bio-degradable which is nice to know, except that everything else is served to you in either plastic cups, plastic spoons, styrofoam containers, plastic straws and is just picked up and tossed at end of meal. I'd be much happier if they used glass and porcelain and metal cutlery. At least then you know it's being washed and reused rather than a one-time use and tossed into trash. That aside, meal was very good, and everyone left full and happy. Service was awesome too. Very attentive staff and patiently explained menu to us newbies.",4,1
The Captain's Boil,"Seafood, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, Cajun/Creole","While eating with your hands off the table is fun, the food is not great and the portions are small for the price.

Will not be going back, nor would I recommend anyone else going. We were all still hungry (after spending $150 on food for 2 adults & 2 kids) that we went to Wendy's afterward.",1,0

The Captain's Boil,"Seafood, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, Cajun/Creole","This place is overrated in terms of the experience. The Louisiana style dining does have a charm but it still isn't worth the price tag. I would expect to have some basics down, but $50 for crab is a bit pricey. All prices are based on lb. The lunch menu looked more appealing. Not to mention that no kids menu. For Dinner, however, suggest that you go next door to the Red Lobster for a better experience and food get rather than dress like a pirate (read plastic gloves and plastic bib) with an oversized garbage bin on your table.",2,0

My experience would have much more enjoyable if they provided the option of a plate/bowl and cutlery. Even your leftovers have to be taken home in a sloppy bag, it's gross. This place is expensive and overrated, and the sauce leaves a bad aftertaste. As far as the menu goes, I'm not a fan of the extra costs associated with ordering sides, when the main protein is so darn expensive to begin with. Nobody just orders a bag of meat.",1,0

Our server was very friendly and she meant well, though we knew english wasn't her first language so it was very difficult to understand her. Overall the seafood was fresh.

The Farmer's House,"Beer, Wine & Spirits, Salad, Tapas/Small Plates, Restaurants, Pizza, Food","I wonder how many people drive through Marda Loop, glance at the cute house on the corner of 33rd Ave and 21st St and continue on oblivious to the hidden gem of a restaurant enclosed in the trees. This is exactly what The Farmer's House is, a hidden gem in Calgary's Marda Loop. The house itself was built in 1912 and truly is a piece of history that still stands strong in Calgary's SW. I was lucky enough to hear about this spot through word of mouth online and was quick to add it to my lists of places to try after skimming some reviews and pictures. The Farmer's House as the name suggests used to be a farmer's house. The building has been refreshed, but they've kept the rustic and old fashioned feel intact and the home still feels cozy inside with tables nestled around an open kitchen. Outback they've actually parked a food truck that belongs to one of the restaurateurs; this now serves as an auxiliary kitchen. What really drew me to The Farmer's House is their beautiful patio; I've been on all kinds of patios but what really makes this patio special is it's immersed within the trees and fencing of the home. This ingenious idea translates to cozy and welcoming patio experience that feels like true country home dining. There's a good mix of sunny and shady spots, so whether you prefer to be right in the sun or lay low there's a spot for you. You'll be surprised how large it actually is; they could fit larger parties as well if need be as well. They also have some lights and heaters for night time, I bet this place would be great to hang out at on a warm summer evening, definitely adding that to the to do list for a future visit! You don't have to take my word for it though; they're actually set-up on Google so you can ""See inside"" the restaurant through photos on Google Maps, great to see a restaurant take advantage of this technology :). The food selection definitely fits the homey and country feel. They feature salads, flatbreads, sharing platters, sandwiches and an all day brunch menu. They also have a daily special board that I found quite large. All the prices were very fair. My fiancée went with a Spinach Salad w/ Chicken and I had the Daily Deli Sandwich which was a Calabrese Pork Loin Sandwich. I also ordered roasted potatoes and their homemade ketchup on the side. Their drink selection is on the smaller side, but features local choices which I found appropriate for the setting. The portion sizes are a great size, they're not overwhelming but still a big enough size that you can enjoy the meal and feel full. The salad was good with a modest sized piece of chicken, nothing too special but the Mustard Herb Vinaigrette was solid. The sandwich was served on a full baguette, but was a tad too toasted and crunchy. Looking past this the flavours was good though and it tasted wholesome. I was very impressed with the roasted potatoes and ketchup though, absolutely delicious. I'm not a ketchup person what so ever, but I used up all the ketchup on my plate, it's that good! One thing I found a bit deceiving and disappointing is that their sign says ""Kitchen & General Store"", naturally I assumed they sold food items, unfortunately I was let down and this was more aesthetic than anything. I actually asked the server if they sold the ketchup which I would've happily purchased lol :). Service was so-so overall, it took quite a while to get acknowledged and served when we first got there. Once we did put in our order there was quite a wait before our drinks were brought out and even longer before we were even given water. Definitely a bit disappointed on that end. We did learn that they were short staffed though and there was a large party in the back we couldn't see, so I was more understanding with this added insight. Towards the end our server was much more attentive when things slowed down and she was definitely able to redeem the bad first impression. I'll definitely give it another go, good overall experience first time around!",4,1

I wish I could remember just what the heck was in it but unfortunately it was high quality Italian things that I can't read or pronounce. Extra foodie points to you if you know all their deli ingredients!

We ordered the Chicken & Pesto and Sausage & Peppers flatbreads, and waited. And waited. We were told the wait was because 6 flatbreads were in at once. There were THREE tables of people. If flatbreads is all you do and three tables gets your kitchen backed up, that's concerning. Finally when the flatbreads came out, I was seriously disappointed. While the Sausage & Pepper WAS good, kudos on the pickled onion, the Chicken and Pesto was a huge sad face. I'm fairly certain the problem was WAY too much cheese, which overtook any of the other flavours, if there were any, although an edge piece with less cheese was still lacking flavour... As a lactose intolerant person I love cheese more than most (it is like a man you can't have that just makes you want him more!!) but this amount of cheese was overkill. And again, if ALL you offer is flatbread, you really should be an ace at them. I really want to support businesses in my community but I probably won't come back here. As for a place to bring KIDS? Ahahahahaa. Well, I GUESS if you're the type of person whose kid appreciates a good chutney....in which case...whoa.",3,0
The Human Bean,"Restaurants, Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch, Food, Juice Bars & Smoothies",Came in and ordered a iced Chai latte. Drove away and realized they just gave me an iced coffee. Also a 12oz iced Chai latte and flavored Rockstar (menu said it was $4) came out to $10 even. Wasn't sure if this was the right price for the total but I wasn't given or offered a receipt.,1,0
The Human Bean,"Restaurants, Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch, Food, Juice Bars & Smoothies","I love this location because it's always close by when I'm either running an errand in Tempe or at something related to ASU. They are about a mile south of the 202. My Dad once lived in Ashland, OR years ago and I vaguely remember going through the original Human Bean drive-thru there. That's where this company got their start. They are known for their hand-crafted espresso drinks and fruit-infused smoothies. And of course every drink is topped with a white chocolate espresso bean. They have a program called the Farm Friendly Direct that allows them to work directly with the farming communities that harvest their beans so that they can build long-term relationships with them. This location has a double drive-thru or you can walk up to the window. You order directly from the barista and not through some intercom which I love. The baristas are usually high energy and personable. I haven't tried one of their teas yet, but I really enjoyed their popular Granita drink. During the holidays they do holiday style cup that is pretty festive.",4,1

On the outside looks like a Dutch bros but with two drive ins (didn't know that until after I drove around). Don't make that mistake of sitting in a line when u don't have to!

The Human Bean,"Restaurants, Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch, Food, Juice Bars & Smoothies","Just left this place and the barista, or whatever you would want to call her, can't get a simple black pineapple tea down correctly. The first drink she made me was a green tea and it was just all pineapple syrup. The second drink she gave was still a green tea. Then I asked if I can just switch my drink to a cold brew and she told me I could keep my pineapple tea while she went off to make me a cold brew. Another lady then came up and was going to charge me for my cold brew drink. I asked her if I could just pay the difference because I was dissatisfied from my first drink, or if I could just get a refund and she made it so complicated. So I left with the drink I first paid for which was the wrong drink. STARBUCKS would have offered me a free drink. I should have went to Starbucks. *Replying to the owner* That barista did not offer a refund. She said ""because it is already in the system they can't refund us the money."" At that point my boyfriend and I told them never mind and drove away because they made it seem so complicated. This place is never getting our business again. Stick to whatever coffee shops you go to and save your money from this ripoff place. They don't like to satisfy their customers.",1,0

They have a double drive thru and I didn't realize you could drive around and go to the other side so I waited behind a car on the right. Neat concept though, plus you can walk up to the window in the middle and order too. The barista was kind and apologized for my wait, as the person ahead of me had ordered multiple drinks. I got the 16oz java chip granita with almond milk, no whip. It was tasty, had the right amount of caffeine and sugar to keep me going. I did need to mix it up since the coffee granules kept sinking to the bottom. Their menu has a wide selection of drinks as well as breakfast burritos and pastries. I like that it's close to ASU but far enough that it's not too busy. I'd come back!",4,1

Just my personal pref, I prefer Dutch over Human Bean, but HB is a close second. Their staff are awesome, the drinks are tasty, creative, and strong! I'd kept my eye on this spot ever since the building was brought in and laid down in October 2017 (just like a permanent trailer), and waited patiently til their soft opening to try them out in November. It's nice that they have two drive thru lanes, but I've honestly never seen them that busy to warrant both. The baristas can be uber creative. A few times I've been feeling open and asked them to make me something based on what I normally buy (plain iced coffee or cold brew w light SF vanilla and almond milk), and it's all been homeruns! Either a jolt of caffeine for a night out with friends or just a good drink to take on a stroll around town, these guys are good. Watch out Kona13, Human Bean is coming for ya!",5,1

Parked and walked up to the window..everyone was so friendly. I asked a man standing outside what he suggested from the menu and he walked my friend and I through some of the different drinks, popular items and what his favorites were. I ended up ordering the Carmel Apple Smoothie and it is delicious! So flavorful and tastes just like the caramel apple suckers you see around Halloween. My friend got the frozen hot chocolate and she really enjoyed it too. I'm not a coffee drinker but was able to find a bunch of things on the menu that would serve as a delicious pick me up on both hot and cooler days.

First off, there are two drive-thrus (***so no more 15 minute Starbucks lines!!!), and a walk up window as well! The staff was cheerful, patient, and very informative... This is key to me, especially in a coffee shop, and The Human Bean nailed it! I ordered a vanilla granita topped with whipped cream. A granita is basically a blended espresso drink and your choice of flavoring - lots to choose from! I would definitely recommend this drink if it's your first time visiting because the staff mentioned that it's a signature of theirs! If you're looking for something a little lighter, I ordered a latte (w/ almond milk and SF Irish cream flavoring) the second time I came, and it was delicious as well! My favorite part is the chocolate covered espresso bean they top all of their drinks with! It's such an adorable touch! I cannot wait to watch this gem grow, grow, & grow!

The Human Bean is the newest drive thru coffee shop in town, with its original ties to Oregon, it's bringing their coffee and steamers to us. They have your traditional offerings from lattes, to breves and some smoothies for the kids. The menu is simple with a few seasonal offerings. I ordered the Snowy Mocha which was perfection. The sweet was subtle and the coffee was perfectly smooth. I ordered Mate Latte for my husband hot and he loved the taste. The best part, each drink comes with a chocolate covered espresso bean! I have been watching their facebook for a while and the cool thing is this stand was a prefab that was just installed less than a month ago! The prices were good and the staff were extremely friendly. The stand has two sides to take your order so you don't have to wait long.

It's a small little shop where you can walk up to the window or drive through. They offer lots of different coffee products but I decided to go with their signature Granita with caramel and whip cream It is soooo good and refreshing and sweet and delicious. I also hear the java chip flavor is amazing so I'll have to try that one next time!! The staff was super friendly and the music they were playing was upbeat and fun.

Full of people btw. The hostess can't answer our questions so they send the assistant manager. Her reasoning equates to not wanting to pay a server to work the upstairs. Fair enough, but how about a call within that two weeks. Just maybe a heads up that you cannot accommodate our request. Now we were stuck doing a planned presentation with no privacy.

We both had the bacon wrapped filet mignon w/ blue cheese and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked to perfection and although I generally dont care for blue cheese all that much, this was outstanding bc they had creamed the cheese and paired it with 3-4 roasted garlic cloves which took the edge off and gave it a really rich and beautiful taste. The creme brulee was large enough for us to share and very very tasty. The pricing was a bit much. We had a $100 gift card, otherwise we would not have chosen this location.

We started with a Caesar salad and calamari, The salad was brown and mostly stems, and the calamari was mediocre at best. It was flavorless and undercooked. Lightly fired should at least be slightly crispy. My hubby ordered the BBQ chicken and ribs. Both were VERY dry and had no flavor. The did come with two small containers of BBQ sauce, which came with a nice think gooey skin on top. I ordered the teriyaki sirloin, cooked medium, and shrimp. The steak was not teriyaki and was char burnt on the outside. Despite the burn, (and me dying of hunger) I ate the first the first third of the steak, it was cooked medium.

Loved the button mushrooms on the side, they were well seasoned! We were told that the dayshift cook was the best! My only teeny comment was the bread seemed over-micorwaved a bit - a little tough but we did not come here for the bread, it was just a bonus!

The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Macleod Trail,"Nightlife, Bars, Restaurants, Seafood, Steakhouses","Beef. Value. Service.Free Parking. Needed a centrally located spot for a lunch meeting...The Keg - why not. And, I am really working to get out of the downtown hustle to a place with ample and free parking. Over the years the Keg has maintained a menu that has something for everyone while delivering in a nice atmosphere with ample staff to meet the lunch rush. Both of us had the steak sandwich and the food arrived as ordered, hot and tasty. The Keg's approach seems to be ""keep it simple"" - after all, why do you want mess up a nice piece of beef with sauces and flavours that do not belong? I'll be back as the server was prompt and efficient and showed up at the right time with water refills etc.",4,1
The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Macleod Trail,"Nightlife, Bars, Restaurants, Seafood, Steakhouses","Went for dinner tonight, I ordered the teriyaki chicken with a side of rice pilaf. My wife had a spinach salad and added chicken to her salad. My son who is eight years old ordered off the kids menu. He had the 1/2 rack of ribs. The meal comes with sourdough bread at the start. Also the kids meals come with a small plate of veggies and dip. If I were to say anything negative about the meal, it's that the chicken that accompanied my wife's spinach salad was a little on the small side. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated with landscape art and some framed photos on other walls. There is a separate bar/lounge area. I remember when this place use to be a nightclub back in my single days i think it was called JR Houston's. In wrapping up, our waiter's name was Alex and he was very good. The total came to just over $50.00 without tip.",4,1

The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Macleod Trail,"Nightlife, Bars, Restaurants, Seafood, Steakhouses","Was here last night for a friend's birthday party. Although I had no complaints about the food when it finally arrived, the service was at a standstill. We had a table of 10. We ordered before the table of 4 sat down. The table of 4 received their appetizers and main before we we had our appetizers. Not sure how that works. 2 hours to get served main. I was livid. To add to the non existant service, they charged my friend for dessert even though it was her birthday. I would not recommend anyone have their birthday party here. There are other steak houses in Calgary that serve better food with less the wait time and will go out of their way to make your birthday feel special.",3,0

Tokyo Stop,"Restaurants, Japanese","Since my arrival to Tempe last year, this is the only teriyaki restaurant I enjoy, I've tried a few other spots around town but none surpass Tokyo Stops superb taste or quality of customer service and affordable pricing. I've never been to Tokyo, but if the eats are as good as Tokyo Stop in Tempe I must visit someday! Just today I enjoyed another delicious meal from here. I must say I am a big fan of Tokyo Stop every time without a glitch my plate is prepared to perfection. Tokyo Stop is a small restaurant with a big taste with very limited seating, therefor I usually always order carry-out. During lunch hours long lines can be expected, which is a good indicator that the food here is pleasantly tasteful. I usually almost always stop by during lunch hours and I can honestly say the ambience here during lunch is pretty calm even though many hungry lunch seekers love to patronize this restaurant. Customers can be seen waiting outside as they wait patiently for their order number to be called next. Inside siting is limited I believe I counted seven small tables some seating four others just for two. I almost always order a lunch box combo which consists of generous portion of spicy teriyaki chicken on a bed of savory brown rice and crispy crap puffs as my preferred choice of side, all this eats for just under nine-dollars. The chicken is soft and tender and to dry as its often made to order. The bed of brown rice they serve with this entrée is usually cooked perfectly, although the standard type of rice served alongside every plate is steamed white grain rice. Every large lunch box comes with two sides, I would recommend you guys try the savory crispy crab puffs made fresh to order every time. Dip them inside a sweet orange sauce that is house made, I know I asked! For those cautious eaters out there, I recommend the steamed vegetables which consist of squash, cabbage, and carrots. I must point out that the best part of ""Lunch Box E"" is the spicy teriyaki sauce, which is made from scratch. It has enough kick to it to satisfy any spice enthusiast, but sweet enough like a proper teriyaki glaze should be. I eat here at least twice a week, I really like how welcoming their customer service is here. every time I choose to patronize this restaurant I am greeted upon my entry. I believe this is a family operated business, with hired help cooking in the kitchen. Customer service here is great, when I call they always recognize my voice and know exactly how I want my order made ""sauce on the side and no chives"" every time! I orders are always fresh and handed over with a warm smile alongside a good amounts of condiments like mustard and soy sauce. Overall Tokyo Stop is a great spot to grab lunch on the go!

Tokyo Stop,"Restaurants, Japanese",Their House chili chicken is delicious and no one else in the valley makes it the way Tokyo Stop does. I took another job and its worth the 30 minute round trip drive. I dump the shiracha sauce on it for added spice. Other eateries around me do not have the menu they do. I think Tokyo Stop is unique.,4,1

Tokyo Stop,"Restaurants, Japanese","Really not impressed. At all. I judge a Japanese restaurant by their katsudon. In this case, it was really ""ma ma""--""not so good"" in Nihongo (Japanese). As a matter of fact, I quit eating it after the second bite and ordered a tonkotsu ramen. This was definitely not a traditional katsudon. Instead of a sliced katsu, steeped in shoyu sauce base with cooked mixed egg and onion slices on top of rice, it was sort of chunks of katsu with sort of egg mixed in with large chopped pieces of onion sort of mixed in with rice--and no shoyu-based sauce. Very dry. Not appetizing. And the katsu was over-cooked and somewhat tough. I would give this katsudon only 1.5 stars. The ramen was better. Decent broth, decent ingredients. However, there was way too much bean sprouts in it which totally got in the way of enjoying the noodles. I really didn't like it being served in a paper cup/bowl, either. I would give the ramen 3 stars. I had a bite of my wife's yakisoba. It was OK, not great. Maybe 2.5 or 3 stars. Service was very friendly. I do not think he is Nihonjin, though or else he really does not know the language because the little Japanese I spoke to him in Japanese tradition, he kind of mumbles something inaudible back.",2,0
Tokyo Stop,"Restaurants, Japanese","I looked over at some other folks eating meat over rice, and those looked like better offerings. Sadly, the ramen was on par with dorm room cooking and should be avoided. The noodles were actually not half bad, it was everything else that let it down. And what was up with dining in out of a paper soup bowl? The pork slices were dry and bland. Not even a good soak in the just salty broth could wake it up. Interestingly half of the bowl was filled with bean sprouts. In itself that's not a problem, but it meant that it took up room that could have been occupied by some other treats. Not a ramen stop by any means. Of note, it's next to a Japanese grocery store and a Japanese bakery.",2,0
Tokyo Stop,"Restaurants, Japanese","absolutely the worst place i've eaten in. i ordered tempura udon and the soup had like dried bamboo sprouts? it smelled like shit and the whole udon bowl tasted so disgusting. too much carrot and overall, not worth the price you pay. my sister ordered spicy ramen i tried to taste the soup and it was way too salty. not going back to this place ever. i ended up eating the mochis that i bought from the japanese market in the same shopping mall for dinner. we left over half because of the weird smell in the food.",1,0
Tokyo Stop,"Restaurants, Japanese","Hole in the wall place that at first glance looks dingy on the inside, forgotten on the outside.

Mistakenly didn't order the lunch& went for the Chicken Katsu /Sweet n Sour combo plate (they even throw a ton of rice). The Katsu was old and had zero flavor & below average dipping sauce. Sweet n Sour chkn was bland and made yesterday. Not recommended nor will I go back voluntarily.",1,0
Tokyo Stop,"Restaurants, Japanese","I am a fan of affordable lunch prices for quality food and was told they have great lunch options at an affordable price. While yes, the food was correctly priced, I was not a fan of the food itself. I ordered a regular orange chicken with fried rice. The portion was a great size. However, the chicken looked and tasted like it was fried yesterday and the fried rice had no semblance of ""crispy""ness that you want from fried rice. The rice looked like white rice with a little soy sauce on it and had absolutely no flavor. Customary fried rice ingredients include eggs, carrots and other veggies, but this had one small bite of carrot pieces and nothing else to keep me from diving in. No seasoning, no flavor. The chicken, which was dark meat, had an overly chewy texture compared to ordinary dark meat. The fry on the chicken, as I alluded to earlier, was old, disgusting and left an unfortunate taste in my mouth. Worst of all, it felt ""heavy"" and it still is sitting in my stomach. I threw out my lunch because if I wanted day old fried chicken with an unflavorful sauce on it, I would have gone to a supermarket. UPDATE: thankfully I was able to abort the food from my stomach with heavy doses of ipecac.",1,0

She took 2 bites and was afraid to eat more. I tasted it. Neither of us liked it, and we agreed it wasn't even close to tasting like sweet and sour anything. The table was sticky. The floor of the kitchen was filthy. I used to pop in here for lunch. Never again.",1,0
Tokyo Stop,"Restaurants, Japanese","I've only eaten the lunch takeout, so my review is on the food and not the entire restaurant experience. For lunch, I had the vegetable bowl combo and crab puffs. First of all, the portion size was huge. You definitely get a lot for your money. Second, it's obvious that the teriyaki sauce was just poured over the vegetables, which made me a little sad. I definitely prefer to have my sauce and veggies cooked together, so the veggies pick up some of the flavors. Not to mention, the flavor of the teriyaki sauce was a little bland. The veggies were cooked very well, although I would have liked some tofu or water chestnuts/bamboo shoots, or sesame seeds in with my veggies. The only veggies that came with the dis were cabbage, broccoli, and carrots; no onion, no garlic, no flavor. The crab puffs were basically crab rangoon, only all the good stuff and not too much cream cheese. The downside was that the ""crab"" in the crab puffs was also bland and my order didn't come with the sweet and sour sauce.",2,0

I can cook better (and I'm pretty pathetic) I ordered sukiyaki and my bf ordered bulgogi. Sukiyaki was just veggies (carrots and lettuce) on top of rice. almost no meat.

Tokyo Stop,"Restaurants, Japanese","I really like their yakisoba noodle dish, and I love that they're always happy to accommodate my request that it come with chicken, beef AND shrimp. They charge a couple bucks more for the indulgence, but to me it's waaaay worth it, I highly recommend placing this special order. Squirt a pool of The Rooster in a corner of the container on your way out . . . ahhh, yeah The hot & spicy anything is good, and for those trying to cut the carbs, the chicken teriyaki salad is a must. Delicious and light. And they automatically put the teriyaki sauce on the side, which is nice, giving you the choice to drench or drizzle The prices are great for the huge portions you get. I learned quickly that you're not just ordering lunch, you're also ordering leftovers. I've never once finished an entree in one sitting. The only negatives . . . I haven't really been impressed with any of the sides, and the sushi is beyond blah. The seating area is tiny, but I've never gone there to sit and eat, so no biggie to me. What I do know, is that when I call for lunch takeout and they say ""10 minutes"", they mean it. Can't beat that Been making a Tokyo Stop run for lunch every couple of months for a few years now. Considering I usually only leave work for lunch a couple times a month, that's a good ratio. Definitely give it a try if you're near University and Priest",4,1
Tokyo Stop,"Restaurants, Japanese","Full Disclosure: I work down the street from this place, that being said, it's general closeness to my work does mean that it's more attractive to me. So basically, Tokyo Stop is a ""fast food"" asian place that delivers HUGE. If you are starving, this is the place to go. I'm serious. You know those mexican places that serve up burritos that keep you full for the entire day? Same concept, different genre of food. So far, I've had 4 meals there, the Sweet and Sour Chicken, The Orange Chicken, the Hot and Spicy Chicken, and the House Chili Chicken, and I'm only going to review the first 3, because the House Chile and the Hot and Spicy were the exact same thing. With the Sweet & Sour/Orange chicken, the restaurant suffers slightly. I attribute that to the fact that the super deep fried pieces of chicken are completely soaked in sauce. For the Sweet & Sour, the addition of Sriracha helped add the ""sour"" to the sauce, but for the Orange...well lets just say I've had my fill of Orange Marmalade for a year. The Hot & Spicy is really where this place shines. The chicken is perfectly cooked( lightly fried in chili oil) and topped off with vegetables and chilis. Goes great with the tableside spicy rice seasoning. And now, the price. For about 6 bucks, you get a huge meal, and wonderful service. My only issue with place (minus the sauce) is the lack of room, but Dunkin Donuts is right down the way, and they have outside tables. It isn't perfect, but it's tasty and fast. I've certainly had better, but I keep coming back.",3,0
Tokyo Stop,"Restaurants, Japanese",Best Japanese curry this side of Kyoto. Other items are pretty good too but you gotta get away from the same old teriyaki people.

Ultimate Cafe,"Restaurants, Italian","I have been living in Toronto for over 2 years and this is HANDS DOWN the worst restaurant experience Ive had here. Every aspect of my experience was atrocious. The server was pleasant but it didnt take long for the night to get off to a bad start. I went for dinner with 3 other people and out came 3 starters but one soup was nowhere to be seen. The server came over to the table numerous times and didnt notice the fact that he had no food in front of him. About 30 minutes passed and out came his main course. At which point he enquired about his missing starter. The server came back and apologised and said that the manager agreed to take a startling $3 off the bill to adequately compensate him. Obviously,we found the $3 gesture a derisory offer but we just werent in the mood to complain and said we would just leave it at that and not make a fuss. From this point onwards there was a plethora of mistakes,one after another. The food itself was poor. We ordered a steak, a pasta dish,a pad thai dish and a teriyaki dish. 4 completely different types of cuisine but they had one thing in common: they tasted awful! The service was very slow and pieces of food came in dribs and drabs, with long wait times in between. One friend of mine,ordered a cappucino and it came old cold.Another ordered cheesecake which against all odds,actually tasted delicious. Completely fed up we decided to just get out of there as quick as possible and to cap everything else off the Credit machine wasnt working!! We were told to sit down and wait for 5 minutes while the machine recharged. At this point we requested to speak to a manager. The server kept making excuses,saying that they were so busy due to TIFF being on and that they usually get great compliments from customers. Firstly,the restaurant was moderately busy but far from hectic. Certainly not enough to justify all the failures on display. And secondly,how does someone else complimenting their dinner help my bad experience? Throughout the night the servers were constantly citing excuses to other customers to explain their shortcomings. It seemed as if complaints meant nothing to them and they were accustomed to excuses. Ive worked in the service industry in the past and would be mortfied if such complaints were directed towards me. Their ambivalence to the complaints was truly shocking and unacceptable. The server re-emerged to say that the manager was too busy to come speak to us and that he would only say the same things that she was saying. Again, this is unacceptable. What sort of respectable manager has no interest in speaking with disgruntled customers? I decided to seek the manager myself. When I asked for the manager I was again told he was ""too busy"" to deal with us. At this point there was an astronomincal 10-15 people in the restaurant,so I understood that he would be unavailable. I enquired as to where the manager was and was told that he actually wasnt there. So we were lied to by multiple employees. The gentleman I spoke to said that the floor manager wasnt there and he was the bar manager, so by virtue of that fact, he was the manager on duty. I believe his name was Min and without a shadow of doubt,he is the most unprofessional, inept manager Ive ever encountered. I explained my frustration and he actually began laughing in my face!! I questioned what was so funny and he just kept saying ""Im so sorry."" Its hard to see sincerity in someones apology when he is on the cusp of full blown laughter. With the restaurant under his command its no surprise how much of a shambles it is. He hadnt even got the professional courtesy to even listen to our concerns. I asked him if he felt a $3 discount was an appropriate solution to a completely spoiled evening where the bill was $151. He continued to laugh and frivolously apologise and offered so explanation. All in all a terrible experience. Awful food Awful service Inexplicable management Theres a hotdog stand on the corner of the street which would offer a more enjoyable and engaging dining experience than The ""Ultimate"" Cafe. The only reason I have given this restaurant 1 star is because Yelp doesnt allow you give 0 stars,which is a far fairer reflection of this restaurant.",1,0

Ultimate Cafe,"Restaurants, Italian","Visited Ultimate Cafe for Friday lunch as I work in the City. I was in a party of 7. I ordered the Stead and Eggs. The food was reasonably good. They served my steak medium - as I ordered it. Buttered toast was crispy and not dry. Potatoes were seasoned properly. Presentation was okay, if a bit understated. Portion size was just right. The only thing that bothered me about the order was that they put what I think was steak sauce on the steak. I don't use steak sauce. Having the kitchen put it there makes it seem they're not confident in their steak. The food took a while to be served. Considering that we were the first group to come in at that time, it still took about 20 minutes for the first plate to be served. On the other hand, the ambiance of the place was better than average. The lighting and decor gives it a pub atmosphere. I find it comfortable personally. Overall, Ultimate Cafe is so-so. Food is good, but nothing to write home about. Probably not a good place to go if you're in a hurry. Perhaps it should be called the Easy Going Cafe. P.S. Although it's an all-day breakfast place, they don't serve pancakes. FYI!",2,0

Made a quick look at the menu and ordered the ultimate breakfast. This consisted of hash browns, sausage, bacon, your choice of toast and eggs made your way. Disappointing. My overcooked bacon and burnt hash browns was unappetizing. The sausage and the scrambled eggs were fine but the experience with the remaining mains was terribly unsettling. I ate only as much to fill my hunger but after a point I just could not eat anymore.

Well, I ordered the Montreal smoked meat and butternut squash soup and was pleasantly surprised; the food was great! The service, however was sub-par, but I did notice a Hiring Now sign in the window. Overall, I can't complain; lunch was cheap and my stomach was satisfied. It's nothing special.

Ultimate Cafe,"Restaurants, Italian","As one walks down King Street between John Street and Peter Street, a bevy of restaurant greeters try to entice you to take a look at their menu. We were feeling Italian-ish and not wanting to spend more than $20 per person. Ultimate Cafe's menu looked ok to my lunch buddy so we walked in. In all honesty, we should've walked away. Upon seating, our server gave us a view of her cleavage and asked us for our drink orders with nary a smile. No smile. A few minutes later, she slammed our water glasses down on the table. Shannon decided on a Chicken with Rose Sauce pasta and a side Caesar salad. I ordered Italian sausage with Tomato Sauce pasta. No smile. She comes back with a basket of stale bread and packets of rock hard butter. Then our food came. Shannon said her pasta was ok . But her Caesar salad was disgusting with its bottled dressing, wilted lettuce, clumps of powdered parmesan and 2 stale croutons. My pasta was also disgusting. The italian sausage was the same sausage sold at hot dog stands. If I wanted street meat, I would've bought it from the vendor. The tomato sauce was nothing special like it came out of a bottle. It seems ready-made convenience food was popular with Ultimate Cafe. Did they actually make anything or was everything just opened up, heated up and plated? Cold and apathetic service + BAD food = Never ever going there again.",1,0
Villa Pizza,"Pizza, Restaurants",Tried their 9.99 deal for a large and it was the most disgusting thing I've ever attempted to eat. They should have paid us to eat this garbage. Now I'm stuck with 2 inedible large pizzas and have to go somewhere else for more. Unfortunately 1 star is required. Definitely a ZERO.,1,0
Villa Pizza,"Pizza, Restaurants","my daughter opted for a slice of plain pizza. it was not hot at all, as i felt the plate it was put on so i went back before she ate it and asked the employee if he could heat it up...well he seemed irritated about me tellng him it was not hot. he looked at me a second and told me it was ""just made"". i'm sorry? bull!!! i paid for something that was not up to standard and you're going to lie and give me an attitude? so he gave me a new slice and after biting into it, my daughter said it was STILL cold, not good at all! what kid doesn't love pizza?! i wouldnt recommend anyone eat here. saving grace for me was that my iced tea was okay",1,0
Villa Pizza,"Pizza, Restaurants",Pizza might be good if it was hot. I have tried to eat this place on numerous occasions and the pizza is never heated through. Real bummer as I think it may be good if heated properly.,2,0
Villa Pizza,"Pizza, Restaurants","My son and I decided to go here after the Anthem Christmas tree lighting; it was well after the crowds had died down. I've been here once before and was not at all impressed so I wasn't expecting too much. Well, it was even worse than the first time! My son, being a kid, opted for a slice of cheese pizza which was still in the oven so at least that was fresh. I opted for some spaghetti. I watched the server put some noodles into a black plastic bowl and top it off with sauce. I looked away for a second and the bowl was no longer on the counter. We stood there for a couple minutes, looking at the server and others behind the counter for some sort of a cue to see if we should stay there or move toward the register or something. The next thing I see is our server kneel down and pull my spaghetti out of the abyss. I asked if she had just pulled it out of a microwave and she said yes. I told her I didn't want it then to which she replied ""well, we microwave all of our food"". I guess that explains part of the reason why it tastes so bad! I think almost everyone knows that you DON'T microwave anything in a plastic dish that isn't meant to go in the microwave! Even the ones that are meant to go in the microwave are questionable. If my kid wouldn't have REALLY wanted pizza we wouldn't have bothered to purchase anything from them. Don't waste your money here or risk your health by getting toxins from microwaved plastic!",1,0
Villa Pizza,"Pizza, Restaurants","Welcome to the only restaurant in the state of AZ that doesn't allow a patron a glass of water with their meal when requested. ""We only have bottled water"" I was told. Nice scambo guys. It backfired here this time though. I left the slice that the cook prepared for me there and found another place to spend my money. Out of principle, I think I'd stay away from these goofs. They don't deserve your hard earned money. To further end, I think its the law in Arizona that an establishment must give you a glass of water when asked even if you're not buying anything. That's part of owning a restaurant in the desert...especially in July. The manager who instructed employees to do this should be fired. No questions asked, do not pass go, do not collect $200. And the young girl with braces who shared this policy with me in such a smug and irreverent manner should be let go too until she learns to question the integrity of a directive. Would she also ""short change a customer"" if she'd been instructed to? Would she do it with the same arrogant demeanor and panache? I worry that she might. She didn't flinch when I took my business elsewhere. She knew beyond question that she was far better than me. And I shutter to think of the message it sends. They don't have tap water back there? How the heck do they wash all of the equipment and utensils when making the food they are serving. Obviously they didn't think through that response too well??? Look at the bad P.R. you just received for thinking its clever to refuse a paying customer a cup of water in hopes of getting them to pay $2.49 for a .20 cent bottle. I'd be willing to bet that either you'll have changed this ludicrous policy by the next time I stop next door to get barbecue, tacos or a pretzel OR you'll be closing up shop shortly thereafter. You guys don't deserve to have my business. Nor anybody I can share this story with.",1,0
Villa Risi,Restaurants,Wow I had such a terrible experience here. I took my 80 year old parents here because my mom wanted to treat us out for dinner. The young waiter was extremely rude and impatient with us. We took a bit of time to order and asked him questions about what he recommended and he acted very annoyed. There were only 2 other tables taken in the restaurant at the time. Our food was nothing special and below our expectations given the previous reviews. I would not recommend this restaurant and will not return.,1,0
Villa Risi,Restaurants,"Excellent food, excellent atmosphere. Very good prices. If you want great Italian food with great atmosphere go here. They should lighten up the outside a little more. You can pass by this gem without even seeing it. Other than that I think they also have a piano singer for added romance on the weekends. Just awesome",5,1
Villa Risi,Restaurants,"I've gone to Villa Risi many times to celebrate special occasions. The food, the service and the atmosphere were all amazing! I recently went there to celebrate Valentines Day. We ordered their Valentines Day specials. It was delicious but they gave very little pasta and the salad was disappointing. It wasn't really worth the money. Maybe they were having an off night. Usually, I love it.",4,1
Villa Risi,Restaurants,I had a recently had a private function at Villa Risi. I spoke to the owner prior and he was very receptive and listened to exactly what I wanted out of the food (I found this step important). The day of the event I was not disappointed. The food was above par. Everyone was raving about it and we all had a great time. I will definitely return.,5,1
Villa Risi,Restaurants,"25 years worth of excellent meals here. If it was closer to Toronto I would go once a week. Special place in my heart, great family run restaurant.",5,1
Vivo Ristorante,"Italian, Restaurants","Birthday dinner with my husband. This is my 4th time here and I have never been disappointed food wise. I had eggplant Parmesan and my husband had sausage peppers on penne pasta. Portions were HUGE. Kaitlyn, our server, was very attentive. This place blows Antonios away!!! Try it; you'll love it!!",5,1
Vivo Ristorante,"Italian, Restaurants",I was given a Vivo gift certificate for my birthday so we went. Service wasn't great. Refills scarce. The food literally made me sick!! My stomach was ill all night. That rarely happens as I am vegetarian and its normally meat that makes one ill. We called and basically they couldn't have cared less that I got sick. There's something seriously wrong when eggplant parmesan makes u violently ill. The cheese may have been bad or the sauce idk but I'm not gonna go back too find out!!!,1,0
Vivo Ristorante,"Italian, Restaurants","This is some of the best, if not THE best pasta and meatballs I have ever eaten in the Cleveland, Ohio area. This place is a winner all the way around with fantastic Italian food, great service, wonderful atmosphere (they really make you feel welcomed) and prices that are really reasonable. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for some of the best Italian you'll have by a long shot.",5,1
Vivo Ristorante,"Italian, Restaurants","Great cozy place, we had a enjoyable dinner started with the stuff hot peppers. Main course I had the Lasagna and my wife had Chicken Parm ( big portion ) this is now are go too Italian Rest. There home made Italian dressing is awesome, there base red sauce is sweet.",4,1
Vivo Ristorante,"Italian, Restaurants","The food is the only reason I gave them 2 stars. I went in on a Wednesday, hours 4p-9p. Now granted I showed up at 8:05p but there was only two other tables occupied. Immediately, I mean within 5 seconds of walking in the door, I was greeted with, ""Do you know we close at 9."" For a second I thought well apparently they clearly do not want my business this late at night. The only reason I stayed was to utilize a Living Social voucher I purchased. So myself and my date ordered drinks and while we enjoyed the complimentary stale bread, the person the greeted us so very nice at the door, continued to stare at us until I mentioned something to her. The entire time I was rushed by the thought that if I didn't get out by 9p, I would feel the wrath of the person that greeted us. The entrée was brought to us before we were finished with our house salads and boxes were offered before our forks were down. While paying for bill I thought, shit, I better chug this beer before I get booted. Good food, nice bar area, aweful décor, aweful service if you go ""in too late"". Took me weeks to go there took them 5 seconds to have me never go back........",2,0
Vivo Ristorante,"Italian, Restaurants","Fraud on top of pathetic food/customer service ******Do Read and Beware****** --------Updated Oct, 6th 2014------- Man! This place is setting itself up for closure! After returning food and repeated attempts of calling for refund (which they promised), finally, today we get hold of owner Chris who says ""he doesn't care"" and will not refund and doesn't want us back. Oh oh, Mr. Chris what made you think we were coming back?? Already talked to our credit card company and filing police report per their suggestion. Watch out folks, stay away from them!! ----------dated sept 22, 2014-------- Pathetic Pathetic Pathetic! We loved them because they are not chain, but to be honest the food taste and quality has gone down the hill. We just ordered Marsalas from them, first time undercooked, bland, no seasoning soggy chicken. We called, lady who introduced herself as manager (perhaps owner) was arrogant and pushy to bring food back for replacement (read with attitude, like she's doing pity on us and giving free food). Second time, we go...instead of replacing our meal, we get handed 2 boxes (supposedly entrees)...we bring them home, pop open, oh my god! Missing beans, and sides!! Even entree is not complete! Here goes our dinner....mood spoilt too! We called again and owner/manager is so rude/arrogant says come tomorrow to get beans! Whattttt? Oh my god, talk customer service! Sure we are not going there again, never ever!!",1,0
Vivo Ristorante,"Italian, Restaurants",Got to love when one of the owners is the chef. Had a business meeting there and the room was perfect but the food was a hit. When you see physicians clean their plates you know it's good. Love their focaccia bread!,5,1
Vivo Ristorante,"Italian, Restaurants","Took my BFF to Vivo for her birthday. I had never been there before. We had actually made a reservation but the hostess seemed confused as to where to seat us. She put us at a table in the front window even though we voiced that we'd rather sit somewhere else. The front window tables seem far removed from the rest of the restaurant, like you are the ""bad kids"" in the room. The hostess seemed very flustered the whole time she was trying to give our menus and actually seemed annoyed when telling us about the drink specials of the night. (We overheard her telling a different table about drinks that she never did mention to us...) The waitress came and she was pleasant enough and brought our drinks reasonably quick. I ordered the chicken parmesan and my BFF ordered tilapia. Both came out looking very good. Both tasted very good. No complaints on the taste of the food but it was nothing outstanding, either. I felt like I could have been at any Italian restaurant anywhere. When our food arrived our waitress asked if anyone wanted fresh grated parmesan and I said yes. Ten minutes later, she finally came back with the cheese. While she apologized profusely for it, I was 75% done with my food by that time. They were not that busy that we should have had that flustered of a hostess and that backed up of a waitress. It would not be my first choice to go back there again.",2,0
Vivo Ristorante,"Italian, Restaurants","We were invited out to dinner with our neighbors who happened to have a couple coupons. The coupons were buy one meal get the second free. Apparently we could not use the two coupons at the same table. The coupon said ""subject to rules of use"". My question is: What are the rules? Were we suppose to sit at separate tables? So to wrap it up, Vivo you lost four customers, you were wrong about the coupon offer, and quit being Coupon Nazis.",1,0
Vivo Ristorante,"Italian, Restaurants","Very Very good!! food has been exceptional all 3 times ive been there. Fair prices, god service accompanied with a nice atmosphere. It is a great place.",5,1
Vivo Ristorante,"Italian, Restaurants","If I focused entirely on the food, 5 stars. Then I add atmosphere at a 2.5, curb appeal also at a 2.5, service at a 3, menu at a 4 and meeting me halfway on a bill issue, I ended up at a 3-3.5. The servings are huge and great. I could've easily shared one meal with my girl and I'm not exactly a light eater. I'm picky about how things look, i found the tile floor and plain drop ceiling boring. If they were going for a small, kinda cozy italian restaurant, they missed the mark. The bar and kitchen (open kitchen behind the bar) area looked clean, everything else was alright. So, the bill issue... We both asked for alla vodka sauce and the server had told someone at the opposite side of our table that there was a small upcharge for switching from marinara to alfredo. My girl and I didn't hear that and proceeded to switch ours from marinara to alla vodka. She didn't tell us about the upcharge. Normally, I'd expect 1, maybe 2 bucks (and to be told that there's an upcharge) and I'm over it. It was $4 EACH. This made a great meal end with annoyance. She took one off and it ended up 2 each, it was fine at the end, but I didn't think I should've had to tell them how insane a $4 upcharge for a ladle full of sauce was. I'll be back, but probably for takeout.",3,0
Vivo Ristorante,"Italian, Restaurants","Myself and two friends went to Vivo for the first time on a Friday night. There were two large parties waiting before us (8 & 6) so we ended up waiting about 20 minutes. It was a super cute, trendy restaurant. It'd be more suitable in Tremont or Ohio City. Once seated our server was pretty attentive. One friend ordered a Blue Moon and he told us there was only one more left so he was holding it for him. While I felt it was pathetic they didn't have more in stock given that it was 7pm on a Friday, I appreciated his honesty. One friend had the tilapia which he enjoyed. I had the gnocchi rossa which was very tasty. Our other friend had the salmon salad which the menu listed as having arugula but she said it was just a spring mix but still good. I love that the kitchen is out in the open and created a nice ambiance. The hostess was awesome. I run a social organization and I have already made plans to bring back a large group to the restaurant and she was great to deal with. I look forward to returning!",4,1
