Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","I have used this service before and was satisfied, until June 20, 2018. I prearranged via telephone a pickup from Terminal 3 to Georgetown and clearly specified a credit card would be used for payment to the driver. The car 570L arrived quickly and was clean and the drive uneventful. When it came time to pay I presented my MasterCard and that's when the problem started. The driver found he had no connection on his payment device. He tried several times to put the card throug, he even tried to put his own card through at one paint in this debacle, and each time the unit said 'no connection'. He then tried driving the car (with me in it) off my property and up and down the street in search of an internet connection, at one point he drove me to an auto repair facility up the road, stopping along the way and staying parked in the auto parking lot trying to obtain internet service. I finally asked after a very extended period to please return to my property to sort it out. It was getting dark and I was travelling alone and getting anxious. I only had a credit card in which to pay with. He proceeded to suggest that he would drive me into Georgetown to an ATM to get money. I said no to this as it would add another 20 minutes to this lengthy ordeal of being trapped in the car.i offered him a cheque which was the only other logical option. H e said no to that idea. He then proceeded to call his dispatch office and I could hear every word. They told him they could not take payments via this route as he was desperately trying to get someone to process my card payment. Then he called 'Gurdeep"", whoever that is, who told him to try charging his unit. He then spent at least 20 minutes looking over every inch of his car for his charger .....to no avail. I insisted after 45 minutes that I was leaving and going into my home and that a cheque would be the only option. He refused to leave my property. I went inside leaving him to pace around my driveway in the dark on the phone with Gurdeep. After another period of home the driver came to my door and asked me to speak to Gurdeep. I explained what was going on to Gurdeep and his impolite aggressive and rude response was that it was 'not his problem that I had no cash'.....and the problem was I lived in Halton Hills. I decided not to communicate any further with Gurdeep as he was not understanding of the situation, and of the fact that I had specified upon booking that I would be paying by credit card. The driver then told me he would call the police for non-payment, then decided after another call, and more pacing around my driveway that Gurdeep would accept my cheque. At this point I was terrified, and it was dark and I was alone. I told the driver I would have my husband (who was in another province) call the company to arrange a credit card payment. The driver still refused to leave. My husband called the company and they finally accepted his card for payment...somehow. The driver sat on the road in front of my house until the hit man Gurdeep received payment I guess. I will NEVER use this service again. It was a horrible experience. I had every intention of paying, and sincerely hope this does not happen to anyone else, especially a female travelling alone.",1,0
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","First time I tried using them the driver was nowhere to be found. Called and found out he was still 30 minutes away! I understand there is traffic, but your job is to drive. Seriously, look/listen/read the traffic reports. Yes it may have been close to rush hour, so maybe leave a bit earlier? I've never had a problem getting to/from places outside the city on time, so I have a hard time understanding why someone who's job it is to do the same thing can't show up on time. Thought I'd give them another shot as maybe it was just a lazy/poor/uncaring driver. This time, 15 minutes before my pickup time, the driver cancels and I'm told they're finding me another vehicle. How long will that take? Don't know. Great. So I've got 15 minutes to either hail an Uber, or wait for someone to maybe show up. No problem. Should have just used Uber in the first place. In summary, if they happen to be sitting right out front and you can get a reasonable flat rate, fair enough. In any other case, use Uber/Lyft/anything else, or risk being told at the last minute that for whatever reason your car isn't showing up....",1,0
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","Driver picked me up on time at 6AM and even knocked on my door instead of ringing my doorbell, in case people were still sleeping. Was courteous and polite the entire ride. Car was in good shape and didn't smell of smoke. Will definitely use them again!",5,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports",First time using this taxi and limo company as I have used others. I was very happy with the services provided. I like the online booking and email confirmation with a reference number. I called the day I needed the limo service and the driver arrived a few minutes a head of time.,5,1

Walked up he brought a van so we could put luggage in. Great space good guy to talk too. Reasonable price. Would recommend,5,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","Can't fault the service. Arrives on time every time. Have used them about a dozen times now and have no complaints at all. Helpful drivers, good rates, clean cars. Highly recommended.",5,1

Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","Made my reservation online. Was picked up on time, driver was courteous, helped with luggage. Flat rate to YYZ from downtown Toronto is $48. Will use them again when I come back for a visit in Toronto.",5,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","Great cars and drivers, can even get a minivan for extra $10 to fit my whole family's sets of skis. Best prices as well vs other airport taxis.",5,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","I've used these guys 3 times now and they make your trip to the airport effortless. Consistent, superior service at a good price. Cars are spotless, drivers courteous, love it!!!",5,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports",Ordered a car and van for a 3:30am pick up and only the van came. Had to call and inquired about the car and the operator told me that the person who took our request only put down 1 vehicle. I was told the price of both the car and van once I confirmed that we needed both cars for pick up. Not impressed,1,0
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","Great experience from Pearson Int'l Terminal 3 to my front door. My driver was a kind gentleman who helped me with my luggage and provided a comfortable ride. The vehicle was clean (and included the all-important charger port to charge a dead iPhone). My flight got in and I was early going through customs. I called and Aeroport accommodated the earlier time right away. Definitely using this service again. Thanks, Aeroport.",5,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","Reserved a minivan with carseat for pick up at Billy Bishop. Upon arrival, the snappy representative advised that she could send me a minivan minus the carseat and it would cost $75 instead of $52 as my email confirmation stated. Not the news you want to hear after getting off a plane with your family and toddler in tow. She was unhelpful and downright rude, saying that they were ""busy"" which is why the carseat was no longer available and that the pricing was a malfunction in their system. Interestingly, when I called to make the booking over the phone weeks prior and when I spoke to them just before getting on the flight, no one mentioned this ""glitch"" - all confirming that the price was $52 until I landed. We spent 20 minutes on the phone and were forced to take the minivan without the carseat. Even though the Taxi and Limo Commission is except from carseat laws, it doesn't mean it's safe or okay. Very poor service and bad business practices. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the actual driver was perfectly friendly and the car was clean.",2,0
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","Very good experience. Driver arrived 10 mins early, loaded all of our bags into the van, drove very safely and got us to YYZ safe and on time. Price was very reasonable, saving us money vs parking at Park N Fly for 2 weeks. We will call this company again",5,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","Brutal driver, a very unhappy person. Seemed like he needed a hug. He scolded us for being 8 minutes late for a five AM ride. He told us his industry relies on being on time, I get that, but sometimes life holds you up. If you can't wait, don't show up 15 minutes early then complain about wasting time. He couldn't let it go either, speeding through our neighbourhood, bottoming out the car over speed bumps, not stopping for stop signs, and going 35 km/h over the speed limit the whole way, trying to save time. We felt unsafe in the car as we tailgated other drivers and were rushed to the airport in a very unpleasant and awkward unprofessional manner. Dude was so pissed at us. He threatened to charge us more for not being on time so I apologised for being a lousy customer and he didn't say another word. Using the card machine on the highway was unsafe as well, he was rushing so hard we were asked to pay before getting to the airport. The rate was good but not at the expense of starting a holiday with a bad attitude and wreckless driving that could have been a bad scene. This is the last time using this cheap service, I would rather pay more for a professional and pleasant ride from an understanding and caring person. The reflection of this company created here makes me want to use alternate car services rather than the traditional taxi cab.",5,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","Took a minivan with bulky cargo from the airport. New-looking, well cared for car; polite driver who would readily chit-chat but didn't force conversation. Slightly more expensive than a taxi but worth it.",4,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","I've tried using this service multiple times from Pearson airport lately (2015) and they have consistently left me hanging. Pre-arranged limo rates are lower than walk-ins, so I typically call as I approach the exit. Most times cars would not arrive when promised (I once even had to called back twice before a car arrived). Today was the last straw. They left me on hold for 5'-10'. I could hear it ring, then put me on hold again. 5'-10' is too long when simply waiting for a limo home. I will be using alternative services in the future.",1,0
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","This is to follow up on my original posting. About two weeks ago I received a call from Amir. He apologized for the inconvenience and poor customer service we received on our trip back from Pearson. As a gesture of goodwill and their sincerity, they wanted to send us a cheque for $20. As of last week (May 15th) we received a formal letter of apology from Aeroport along with a cheque. We have been advised the driver (Dodge minivan car #190) has been suspended and placed on 3 months probation. We accept Aeroport's apology. More to the point, we are glad to hear the action it has taken to address our concerns. We may consider using them again in future but only for business purposes.",4,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","I have used them twice and have not had a bad experience. They come on time. Call to inform of their arrival. Cars are clean, spacious and drivers are polite and never intrusive. Price is comparable/ less to what uber or beck taxi would charge (imho).",5,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","We travel nationally and internationally at least 10 times a year. We usually have an uneventful experience with them - after all, it's just a taxi service from and to the airport, not a full fledge catering-to-your needs service experience. Today was the exception and it's a pity because now we've been totally turned off by their service and will be using alternative companies from now. The company provides a wake up call, a call when the driver gets to the door and a preset quote. We always call from our landline which we use for our freelance services always requests them to call us to the cellphone line for both the wake up and the at-the-door phone call (we have tenants and we don't want to wake them up & the landline is not in the same floor as our bedroom). They usually oblige. Today they called the landline for both the wake up call (4:00 am) and the at-the-door call (4:45am). Being in a different floor than our bedroom, both calls when to our automatic voicemail by the time we went running to that floor. We wake up with our own alarm (4:00am) and expecting the driver to tell us when he was ready & not seeing him approach the door, we came out the door at 4:50am. After loading up the car with the suitcases and getting into the car (4:54am), the driver proceeds to tell us there will be an extra $10 charge because he had to wait 10 minutes for us. I look at my iphone and it's 4:54 am but it's really too early to be arguing about one minute. However, he then tell us in a confrontational tone that we SHOULD HAVE answered the phone and that he knocked and knocked at the door (he didn't because we would have heard him as the front door is right about our bedroom). Because he now has pissed us off, we tell him he ""should have"" called the cellphone line as requested. He claims he did and gets agitated about ""the rules"" and so on and so on. Again, too early to be arguing about $10 but then he continues going on and on - now we're feeling guilty because it seems this 9 minutes delay has costs him his livelihood and then he proceeds to show me his cellphone where it shows he indeed calls a cellphone line. Not ours mind you - different by a number - and after I pointed that to him, he said that's what he was told and that it'll be $10 more for the delay. Again, it's only $10 but the fact that made the rest of the ride uncomfortable and it made our holiday start in the wrong foot, this experience tarnished out view of this whole company and again, will be using an alternate company from now on. Too bad because we really liked them before.",2,0
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","It is the worst airport limo service. I have had great experience with them in the past. But I used their service 5-6 months ago and it was the worst possible. I called the cab around 4:20. Their policy allows a waiting time of 10 minutes. I was inside the cab at 4:27 PM. The driver said extra charge. I said for what? And then he made me call the customer service at 4:28. The representative stated the policy, I said I am calling you from inside the cab at 4:28. How is it possible for me to be late in any way? We debated over the charge. I was not willing to pay a penny. He said I have to trust the driver. I was thinking how dumb are you? I mean how was it possible for me to be sitting with the driver in the cab 2 minutes before the charge applies, and am even talking to you! If it had been 4:30, yes I would pay based on their policy. He said if you can afford $5, which I am sure you cannot afford, pay it. I said I cannot afford it. It was not about the money but abt the principle and attitude. The driver said people give more tip then $5 and you are debating over this. I said you lied, that is the point. Both him and the customer service guy had been super rude. I gave him zero tip. The guy did not deserve a penny. Then he said I have a family too and have to feed them. I said, had you not been a lying scumbag I would have paid 15 percent as I always do. Then the driver said, ""you're this nationality right"" you people are like this. I told him to **** off and left. Oh and also he had not helped me with a single bag in or out of the limo. I will never use their service again, even if they offered it for free. I would strongly recommend against it.",1,0
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","My experience with these guys have been pretty positive. Mind you this was my first time using them and they already left me with a good impression so that's something! A normal cab ride for me to the airport is usually $100 after tips because I live in the burbs. Given that I was traveling on business and wanted to save the company money, I decided to look up airport shuttle services online for a fixed rate and this company was listed first on google. It got decent reviews on yelp so I'm like hey why not? What's to lose? I asked for them to pick me up at 8:30am initially for the next day and then later changed my mind to 8am. They were very accommodating. Day of, they arrived 5 mins early and rang my doorbell to let me know he arrived. He helped me load my luggage and offered a quiet and respectful ride the entire way. Traffic was good and I ended up only paying $58 flat rate. That's cheaper than cabbing from dt! Overall I would use them again and I do recommend them.",5,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","Booked a pickup online for Saturday at 6:30am, driver arrived 15 mins early, but didn't rush me to get going. Super clean and courtesy. Will definitely use them again!",5,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","I wouldn't recommend this service. Was verbally abused by a driver, who told me I shouldn't f-ing get in his car if I had a cough. He would not provide a car number or his name, and when I called the company they did not seem to care nor did they take any steps to resolve or correct the issue.",1,0
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","Used these guys for a flight out on new years day, they were there 15 minutes prior to the 6:30am I had requested - I said a bit earlier as I was worried they'd be late...it's new years day after all! But they were there and got me there as quickly and smoothly as possible. Would defiantly use again!",5,1
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","Note: I just tried to rebook the same exact trip I took previously with Aeroport Taxi, from my residence in downtown Toronto to Billy Bishop, but the price quoted this time was far higher. Not sure why the price has suddenly skyrocketed, but I declined to book and will now be looking for a more reasonably priced taxi service.",2,0
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports","The last time I prebooked, the car was 10 mins late. The second time, after 10 mins and no car, I called. As is typical, a rude and attitude filled woman picked up the phone. I mentioned my car had not arrived, and she abruptly said please hold. Sat on hold for about 4 mins. Another woman, could have been the same one, came on the line and said ""airport taxi how can I help you"". I said I was on hold waiting for info on my missing car and she asked for my address again. Then she barked that he was two mins away. About five mins later a taxi pulled up. When I asked, he mentioned that he had just been dispatched - I figured as much since I had requested a limo. I won't trust my getting to the airport on time to this company again. Bonus that I won't have to deal with that rude woman again. I sent this feedback directly to them requesting a response. Silence. Mistakes happen... How you handle them is how you keep customers.",1,0
Aeroport Taxi & Limousine Service,"Hotels & Travel, Airport Shuttles, Transportation, Taxis, Limos, Airports",Used these guys for pick up from the home to the airport. Their prices are fair & the car they sent was nice. It was a sedan with black leather seats & the driver was also very friendly & professional. We always use Aeroport whenever we travel.,4,1
Air Canada,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel","Possibly the worst flight ever. We used United frequent flier miles RT. Flew in on United SFO to YCC. Returning home it was Air Canada which is Star Alliance partner. Our original departure time was changed a few months prior to our trip. No problem. Yesterday our flight home was at 6:40pm. On time departure. We got to YCC around 3:30pm as it was only a 15 minute drive from our hotel. Went through security, immigration and customs. Great. Walked over to Gate 89. Hung out. 5:16pm - notification of flight delay. One hour delay. 5:40pm, notification. still one hour delay. 5:41pm - notification, gate change to 82. 6:24pm, notification, departure 7:30pm, gate 70. 6:41pm - notification, departure 8:30pm, . 7:05pm - notification, departure 8:50p.m. The entire wing of the terminal was closing down. The various food places went dark around 8pm. Only gate 70 was still open. That was for our flight home. Finally boarded around 8:50pm. Claimed flat tire. Gave us a meal voucher $10 CAD. No free alcohol. Turned out hardly any food available onboard to redeem the voucher. Said it's good for one year, and able to use at the airport. What a joke. The plane itself was tiny. A Bombardier. Two seats on each side of the aisle. So narrow. Couldn't get my 19"" carryon luggage in the overhead. Had to shove under the seat after much manipulation. Rested my feet on the luggage. No leg room. A heads up from the ticket counter could have helped regarding luggage requirements. And the flight crew for our flight was also waiting to board. Once we were onboard the flight attendants were not very helpful. No sense of urgency. Did I say it was the worst flight ever?",1,0
Air Canada,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel",Air Canada lost my baggage from Vancouver to Calgary. I have travelled from Philippines and had transferred from different airports but I'm surprised I will lose my baggage inside Canada. I am really disappointed from this Airline since they lost my baggage and barely contacted me regarding my lost baggage. It's been more than 2 months since I arrived in Canada and I have file a lost baggage report. After waiting for 2 months I received an email from them if I have received the lost baggage and clearly I did not. Then they asked me to provide receipts and bank statements of all the things that are inside the baggage and clearly I do not keep receipts and most things that are in that baggage are from Philippines which I do not know how to get a bank statement from. And my family is really disappointed for all the hassle they have done already because my sister had limited edition Hello Kitty collections in there that came from Japan as a gift from her. And its really hassle not only for me but to my whole family because it is not just my stuff inside that baggage and we surely can't provide receipts to everything that is in there. So I do not recommend this Airline at all. I am really disappointed because I have expected a lot from this Airline,1,0
Air Canada,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel","Quiet possibly THE WORST airline in North America. Lost our luggage coming home from South America, delivered it to us 36 hours after we arrived with no communication from their side what so ever, absolutely no compensation or appology. AND to top it all off they melted the suitcase and told us they had 35 business days to repair or replace the suitcase! 35 business days!!!...what reality does this company work in...clearly not one it's customers are in. We can't wait 35 business days to have this dealt with, we travel for business and need our luggage in working condition, which is a perfectly reasonable expectation that we would receive our luggage back in working order on the other side when we drop it off at the check-in.",1,0

Air Canada,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel","Your wretched staff at Calgary International is an embarrassment to the airline industry. The outlandish and outright anti-American sentiments from your staff just go to show how far gone your company is. Disrespectful during our entire process checking in, your staff could use some serious courtesy training. But, that probably won't happen because your poor service is just ""how it is"" according to your flight attendants. Nice work. You've managed to give this yelper a reason to write his first 1-Star airline review after 20 years of travel. I wish I could write a hundred reviews about your staff. It wouldn't be enough to justify how poorly you treated us.",1,0
Air Canada,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel","a. Booking - Air Canada booking process was pleasant. We did receive a 20% off coupon because one of our previous flights had entertainment system screwed up. Better than an empty apology, I guess. Moreover, Air Canada was more than accommodative during Hurricane Harvey and allowed us to rebook our flights multiple times to avoid Houston area. b. Checkin@Calgary - Horrible experience with Air Canada counters at Calgary airport. The staff was incompetent and rude. Firstly, the online check in process didn't work for us just because we had a visa to be verified, so we couldn't select our seats or get earlier boarding zones. We only had cabin luggage, so we tried checking in at the kiosks; which also didn't let us complete checking, there were attendants there but refused to help and asked us to get in line with check in luggage passengers. There were no separate lines for online checked in/baggage drop off. There was about 45 mins of line for a 7 am flight and staff showed no sense of urgency. Finally we get to a counter and their passport scanner malfunctions, the attendant looked confused, kept asking other attendants on how to operate the screens (typed with 1 finger). When we asked to hurry, she (Karen) tried to blame it on our passports - we have travelled 25+ countries without any issues with the same passports. We stood in line again and went to another agent, who was able to check us in. Turns out, previous agent forgot some key steps to capture our address. Now, the new agent (Carolina) forced us to check in our cabin luggage and charged us $50. That was clearly unfair as all other passengers had equal (if not bigger) luggage. Keep in mind, this was 30min before the flight - so they coerced us to pay without any time to justify or argue. Also, now even loading the luggage onto the belt is a customer responsibility, Air Canada is too cheap to hire a minimum wage porter. We ran to the gate and barely made it to boarding. Of course, there - they were courtesy checking in cabin luggage for all other passengers. When I complained to the gate agent, her response was precisely ""Write an email"", ""I am busy boarding 195 people"" & ""Whatever"". I demand a full refund of my luggage fees ($50).",1,0
Air Canada,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel","Air Canada charge up to 4 times what Air New Zealand do. On top of this they want to charge extra for checked baggage.

Air Canada,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel","If I could give you no stars I would. If you're thinking about flying somewhere or are just new in Canada and are thinking about booking a flight DO NOT BOOK IT WITH AIR CANADA.

So here's my story: Me and my boyfriend booked our flight to Vancouver in October (that's right folks, four months ago) and Air Canada over sold our flight. Our 755 am flight turned into a 4pm flight? How is that even fucking possible. How does a company even do this?

Well got there early (check) threw security no issue (check) then get to gate only to be told the plane was delayed 4 hours if it leaves, tried to ask what was going on and the agent seemed like it was an annoyance that I had asked, I was told maybe it leaves at 10 maybe it doesn't they'd let me know closer to then. So I asked about connections since I'm clearly missing mine, was told once we were in the air they would be trying to figure that out?

Now nearly 5 hours later they put us on the plane, baby's crying everyone mad, I even traded my pillow cause it was coooveeeerred in hair and looked like some one threw up on it! finally get everything started and of course again ""maintenance issue"" only to sit for another 45 minutes with no information. And turned off the movies and entertainment. Finally arrived in Heathrow had to set it up for my bags to get to Brussels my self. Finally arrive in Brussels 10 hours late! But im just happy to be there! Buuuuuuuut my bags don't show so now just sitting and waiting hoping it shows befor I change city's and have to wear the same clothes for 10 Days! Yay! I do want to give a shout out the crew they scrounged up in Calgary it was really great they came and we were aloud to leave at all I'm very thankful to them.",1,0
Air Canada,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel","Wanted to ask help from this lady today that was standing in front of the check in line entrance. She was talking to another employee and the other employee stopped talking to let me ask the lady a question. She just looked at me and kept talking to him. I was almost late to checking in my flight, but I tried not to interrupt her and let her finish. I was waiting for her for almost minute until I finally interrupted her conversation. Good customer service will attend to their customers first than having a conversation with your coworker which could of waited.",1,0
Air Canada,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel",Stuck on the Tarmac for two hours and no end in sight.

Air Canada,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel","I am tired of hearing people say oh no Air Canada. I have flown both West Jet and Air Canada and they are similar yet different. I choose to fly with Air Canada to LHR from Calgary over BA - why $600 why. I have flown BA before and they were fantastic, but not $600 fantastic. My last trip to LHR, I called ahead in an attempt to change my seat. I wanted to possibly upgrade to business using my points if I could as I had a lot of work to get done and the space would be welcome. My dismay when I come to find out they can't even move me to the emergency rows with the bit of extra leg room because it appears the flight is fully booked. That's fine, as long as I have a seat I am ok. To the second, 24 hours before my flight I log into the website and 'check-in'. I have my seat we are all ok. International flight - I get to the airport with loads of time to spare - you never know with security etc so better to be on the other side, drink a coffee and play solitaire than freaking out and running. Note - the Maple Leaf Lounge - do it! Totally worth the extra! I didn't this flight, I regret it. *SIGH* I get to the gate and there are young children running around and misbehaving, then it happened the hell of all hells. Not one but TWO groups of high school students arrive at the gate ... so now I am sitting there thinking - WHY DID I CHEAP OUT ON THE MAPLE LEAF LOUNGE WHY!? Suddenly, amongst the chaos, a wave of panic hits me - my name is being called to the desk. Don't bump me I have tickets to the theatre I can't miss this flight. (Yeah ok not the brightest move to book theatre tickets on the night you arrive but hey I also cheaped out on the lounge so I know sometimes I am not bright). I go up to the counter, and the lovely staff member asked if I could move seats because one of those families with the hellish children didn't select seats when the booked and couldn't get them together due to the volume of sales on the flight. But lucky me they could put me in a window seat a few dozen rows back. I will admit, this is where I may have got a bit cheeky, oh ok a LOT cheeky. I may have and did say, ""I don't have to move do I, I hate window seats. I could be persuaded to move if you could find me a seat in business?"" Click click click, print. Here is your boarding pass you are now in 8K. Thank you AC staffer, it has been a pleasure doing business with you. CLINK CLINK FIRST CLASS! Now my fiscally unadventurous side will never permit me to pay for first class I just cannae do it (cheesy Scots accent). However, it is heaven. Priority boarding. Champagne (probably sparkling white, but leave me with the fantasy) mixed with orange juice so you don't feel so alcoholic - in REAL glass. A menu, a choice with appetizers and puddings and METAL CULTERY! A seat that fully reclines an forms a bed. A pod... a pod. No one touching you or coughing on you. Then the little bag of essentials - socks, eye mask, ear plugs, lip balm, toothbrush and paste, a mint. It was fabulous! A easy flight that I have done a few dozen times - noise free from the screaming children and the excited high schoolers. It made me remember my high school trip across the pond - for those that suffered on our flight, I am sorry. Before we land, boarding cards and this lovely little silver ticket - akin to the golden ticket in the famed Willie Wonka. What is it for - fast tracking to Immigration. No queue waiting - just walk up show the silver card and be shown expeditiously to an immigration officer. Meanwhile, the cattle in economy (where I will find myself again) are still waiting to disembark. Air Canada provided this experience, thankfully because some family of lazy idiots couldn't select their seats when they purchased their family of 5 tickets. But they did it gracefully and with a smile and without a fuss. They were spectacular. Anytime I have had to call - ie. change a flight date - the customer service staff have been so kind and helpful. Remember, you are not the first person to call and yell and scream that day. They are paid little and take a lot. If you are funny and kind and appreciative they will help you any way they can. That has been my experience. I love Air Canada - note did you see the Air Canada Christmas advert - yeah I LOVE AIR CANADA!",5,1
Air Canada,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel","Flying Air Canada this holiday season has forever branded them as the worst airline I have ever flown with the most horrifyingly awful customer service I have ever encountered. After being denied boarding on my initial trip (they over booked the flight), I had to stay in Toronto overnight--almost 12 hours until my next flight. Got to my destination almost 24 hours later than I was supposed to. THEN, on the return trip, they routed me a crazy route (Toronto-Ottawa-Vancouver...wtf!) and there were delays all over the place. When I FINALLY reached Vancouver (over 21 hours from my starting time), I had no luggage. Here's where it gets really awful: I'm on DAY FOUR WITH NO LUGGAGE! Four days!!! No deodorant, no makeup, no clean clothes. It takes at least one hour to reach someone on the baggage services hotline. It took me two hours of waiting online for a chat representative to return my chat. And after all that waiting, the chat rep said that because of high chat volume he couldn't retrieve my file. 96 hours without luggage. I will NEVER ever fly Air Canada again. Save yourself!",1,0
Air Canada,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel","Every time I have flown with Air Canada, it's been over the top, outrageously ridiculous the stuff that ends up happening. First of all, every single time I have flown with Air Canada, they have overbooked and I've been bumped. Every, single, time. Last time I missed the meeting I was flying there for, so it was really pointless. They offered me a $200 voucher for this, and when I did get to Toronto, they had taken my luggage of the plane in Calgary, and left it down at baggage because they thought I wasn't going to fly. So I missed my first meeting, and had no clothing, makeup, etc...for my next. So, when my partner had to fly home for a funeral in the most recent scenario, I thought I'd let him use the voucher. We called and reserved a flight and were told that no problem, we could use it. It was a last minute flight to Toronto, so of course the fees were astronomical. When we tried to pay, we were told that no, we actually could not use the voucher because our last names were different...? They were completely heartless as well - they treated us like we were a major inconvenience and actually said 'I don't need to know about the funeral part, that's irrelevant'....uhhhh. Ok? We were also told they had reserved our flight at a certain fee, but when we went to pay, the rate went up. We were given a reservation code SPECIFICALLY because of this happening. But they would not honour it. It was now $300 more for the flight, AND they would use the voucher, so another $200 more. That's a total of $500, on top of the already $600 flight. The flight would be $1100 for one person. And they wouldn't offer a bereavement fee. Needless to say, we couldn't fly home. I am so disgusted with this airline. They woman on the phone was absolutely heartless and they did absolutely nothing to help us. To be honest, I don't think they really even cared if we booked a flight with them. I really hope that they end up like many other airlines that forgot who's paying them, and go bankrupt.",1,0
Airmiles Customer Service,"Travel Services, Hotels & Travel","My oh My...What is airmiles doing? Web site down, phone lines out, no way to use your points before they expire. Very clever airmiles!!! What a great way to mess your members around even more, by imposing an expiration date and then not being able to use them because you cant get on line or get an agent on the phone...its a disgrace and after 20 years of collecting for my dream holiday I will no longer participate in this program, so listen up airmiles sponsors...those huge fees you pay the airmiles company to be a member won't have any value as like myself most people will no longer shop in the business that offer airmiles because the points have no value...I'm done with airmiles, they can go fly a kite for all I care. Yet another example of a Greedy company with no vision or interest in their customers...I call upon everyone to boycott and convince others not to participate or use Airmiles anymore. Let us show this company with our wallets and shop elsewhere and then see how fast they change their policy.",1,0
Airmiles Customer Service,"Travel Services, Hotels & Travel",Not a great point system. I used to be so into it but then I realize it's not worth my time. Their points do expire . Now they have dream and cash which to me is pretty dumb. It limits on how you can use your points . Almost no flexibility. They have black out period as well. Points are hard to accumulate unless you are willing to spend a lot.,1,0
Airmiles Customer Service,"Travel Services, Hotels & Travel","I've collected Airmiles since the early '90s and have watched the benefits dwindle dramatically. There used to be a glossy catalogue and many rewards choices, and the no. of miles needed for travel was very reasonable. I've bought tickets for others as well as for myself for NYC. Now, there few rewards to choose from, miles required for flights have increased ridiculously, and as mentioned by another poster, the taxes/surcharge are so high it's ridiculous. The one reward I plunked my miles into lately was BOM investment certificates (it was great - growing a savings account with just my Airmiles). Now that's been discontinued. My greatest complaint is customer service, more specifically, the lack of it. I called today about a discrepancy, waited on hold for a while, and then chose the call-back option (60 - 120 mins. wait) More than 3 1/2 later, my call-back came. They weren't done tormenting me - I then sat on hold listening to Muzak for another 25 minutes. This is ridiculous, thinks I, so while still holding, I decided to try their Live Chat. That would be faster, right? Nope. There were, my screen told me, 6 persons ahead of me, and it was almost closing time back East. Making a customer wait for over 4 hours, removing the majority of rewards they used to offer, raising no. of miles for flights ridiculously, overcharging for flight charges, and now deleting miles after 5 years all point to a sad trend today: disrespect and greed.",1,0
Airmiles Customer Service,"Travel Services, Hotels & Travel","I've been a long time collector of Airmiles for about 20 years now. I buy everything on my credit card and my mom uses my credit card to pay bills so that I get the miles. I take a lot of trips in the US to see concerts, therefore, the miles help drastically when it comes to keeping the travel costs low. About 60% of my over all travel expenses is due to miles. In the past 5 years the miles plan has changed drastically to unfair circumstances. I used the miles to book two trips: To see David Gilmour in March and for Coachella 2016 to see my long time favorite band Guns N' Roses. 1. Airmiles now has an expiry of 5 years which makes all your miles that you create dated. The problem is that the Airmiles site doesn't tell you which points are valid or a summary of yearly points accumulated and their associated expiry. If they've expired they just vanish. They're allowed to do this 'cause we signed and terms and agreement document and nor are they obliged to tell customers of the changes in the program. We are to figure this out for ourselves which is what I did in this case. 2. The value of each Mile collected has dropped without notice from 16.2 cents value to 11.2 cents per Mile. Worth change without notice. 3. If you book your Flight Using Airmiles you have to pay double the tax which is not covered by Miles. You also have to pay a Fuel Surcharge which is normally added to the bass fair when booking with the airline direct. They've moved it to the tax section forcing reward collectors to pay this amount. Over all on a $1,000 valued flight you're only saving $300. A savings is a savings in the long run but still annoying. 4. Black out periods weren't as bad before. They were an annoyance but doable. They've now made it impossible with unrealistic flight availabilities that people just give up and book directly regular price with the airlines direct. Stupid layovers that are 12 hours between flights forcing you to book a hotel. When you add the hotel cost in you might as well have booked with the airline directly or through Expedia for an easier flight. 5. If you do a search on the Airmiles sight they don't show you all options available. You may find a perfect schedule earlier in the afternoon and then in the evening it's mysteriously vanished even though Expedia has those seats available. The real kick in the ass is that the following day, after you have booked your evening Miles option from the night before, the original listing is reposted. You have to keep checking every two hours on the Airmiles sight. Happy Coachella 2016! Hopefully dealing with the hotel and show tickets is less of a bullshit crap shoot than this. P.S. I am in the process of changing my type of credit card and I am done with Airmiles. I've cashed in the remainder and bought my parents gift cards to the movie theater so that they can have multiple date nights and watch some Bollywood movies at Silvercity Metrotown. My mom and I are seeing Star Wars next week.",1,0
Airmiles Customer Service,"Travel Services, Hotels & Travel","trying to call airmiles and speaking to a representative is a fulltime job. It requires 40+ hours a week till you actually speak to someone and when you do they will tell you your birthday is wrong ???? WRONG???? how is MY birthday wrong? Then after waiting a lifetime to talk to someone they want YOU to mail in appropriate documents to prove your birthday.

Airmiles Customer Service,"Travel Services, Hotels & Travel","Let me just start by saying that I have been collecting airmiles for a minute. When I say a 'minute', I mean like 6 years. Holy eff. In these 6 years, I've only managed to collect enough points for 2 domestic trips (That's pretty ridiculous...considering I use my airmiles card like it's goin' out of style). The first trip I booked was a couple of years ago when I went to visit 'someone' (heh heh heh) in Victoria, BC (actually, it was in Duncan, BC, but y'all probably don't know where that is - It's about an hour away from Victoria). The second trip, I *just* booked. I'm so excited I think I'm going to explode. But I'll hold off on that so I can get on the plane :) I'm headin' back to the T-Dot. Yeah baby! I was actually supposed to head there in February, but I ended up deferring the visit until next month. Holy crap, do you even care about all this? Sorry - I'm just so excited, I had to tell someone ;) ANYWAYS, aside from the fact that it takes *forever* to collect enough airmiles to go anywhere (which, as I mentioned earlier, is RIDICULOUS), the young chap I spoke with on the phone was FANTASTIC. He was a total sweetheart, and booked my flight within a few minutes. He initially couldn't find the times that I was lookin' for, but with a bit of persuasiveness, he magically found exactly what I was looking for ;) I am extremely impressed with the quality of service I got with the airmiles folk. Their service was efficient, friendly, quick and successful in getting me *exactly* what I wanted. Yay for airmiles. Yay for buddy who helped me with my flights. And of course, yay for me for gettin' to see my peeps in T-3 weeks. Peace Out Bitches!",4,1
Allegiant Airlines,"Transportation, Hotels & Travel, Airlines",Its not as cheap as you think it is. Booked a trip a few days ago to go see my son in Reno. The tickets are 260.00 round trip plus 18.00 for a check in bag. Changed the return date today instead of 4 days to make it 2 days. They charge a 200.00 change fee. When 2 people flying was 278.00 with one bag fee. What company in their right mind is going to charge almost 75 percent to change. They must not like their customers for that.

We were not charged for the child seats which we provided them. Upon entering the plane, it could be observed that it had its years. The upholstery was worn and faded. The area around the air and lights was worn down with color faded in these areas.

Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I stayed in the BEAUTIFUL 2 bedroom pent house suite for my friends bachelor party. Everything was perfect from beginning to end. We were given priority check in/check out in our own private lobby and had our own private elevators for easy and quick access back to the room. We were given air port transportation to and from the airport by limousine, however my limo driver did leave before finding me on the way In and I had to wait an additional half hour for the next car. (Very annoying considering I was on the phone with them and given instructions on where to meet the driver. I also had to push back a few activities I had planned.) Nice touch however sky lofts at MGM offer rolls Royce transportation. They offer free beverages and light breakfast as well as wine at night in the lobby. The pent house had two large bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. (2 full) the master baths had an amazing jacuzzi tub and a steam room built in the shower. (Amazing for helping out with hangovers lol) The beds were very comfortable and the digital I pads through your the house was by far the best part. They allow you to control practically EVERYTHING. (Lights/temp/shades/mood/music/tv/Spa services/room service etc) it would have been nice to offer a turn down service or perhaps a butler for the suites but I'm sure just a little extra money can do that for you here.

Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Our recent trip to Aria was for my wife's Birthday. We arrived around 1pm and went to check in. We asked for an upgrade at check in as I am an M Life Gold player and occasionally get complimentary upgrades at check in. The lady at check in said she could upgrade us to a Sky Suite for $60.00 per night more which I accepted. She told me our room would be ready shortly and we will receive a text when it will be ready. 3 hours later I received a text that our room is ready. Keep in mind that regular check in is at 3pm and we didn't get to our room till 4pm was disappointing but we had fun gambling in the mean time. We were only in the room for maybe 30 minutes before the door bell rang and the gentleman at the door told us they forgot to restock the mini fridge and he would like to re stock it. What a wonderful way to spark the mood for my wife's birthday evening... Now I've waited 3 hours for my ""upgraded room"" and they forgot to restock the fridge. I can still look past that! My wife wanted to go to the gym prior to going to dinner since we had a 7pm reservation at Julian Serrano. I went to shower while she was working out so she could have the restroom after she returned. When I walked into the shower I noticed the tub wasn't cleaned and had paper towels still in it from the maid. I called housekeeping and ask them to come and re clean the tub as I'm sure my wife wanted a bath during our stay. After showering I went to brush my teeth at which point the sink backed up and didn't drain... So I called again told them now my wife who is at the gym is going to be coming back to what is suppose to be a 5 star room with a dirty tub and sink full of dirty water. I was frustrated spoke with a supervisor who apologized and gave me a $50.00 dollar food credit. In my opinion I should have been refunded the who upgrade cost - because lets face it, whats the point of upgrading at this point... We went to dinner and had a great dinner. We came back into the room and we were laying in of the queen beds when we realized the light switched the controlled the reading lights over the bed are wired backwards. Terrific! So now you have to get out of bed to turn off the reading the lights because they are controlled by the light switch next to the other bed. Needless to say the Sky Suites didn't come close to giving us the 5 star experience I was hoping for my wife's Birthday. I left disappointed in the management that addressed all of my concerns with my stay as well, as I felt they didn't really care. It was more of.. ""Oh it isn't a big deal, here is $50.00 bucks that will make up for it""",2,0
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I'm a bit delayed in writing this review; I'm not a regular Yelper by far. But I've been coming to the Aria since 2009. I've spent many happy times here with my friends and family (and it happened to be the location of the last time I really took a trip with my dad, who cannot travel anymore). So for my 50th birthday, I wanted to pull out all stops celebrate with my best friends. Only get to celebrate your 50th once, right? The SkySuites experience starts way before the actual trip, their concierge Marysol was responsive and very much helpful - and you don't have to be a ""whale"" or anything to be treated so well. I didn't find this out till after our arrival, but she helped my friends get a hilarious birthday cake for me. SkySuites commands a bit of a premium but for a truly special, once in a lifetime occasion, I recommend the splurge! The good: 1. Quick, responsive, happy and friendly service. It does make a difference. If you let them know you or someone else is celebrating a special event - they will know and leave notes and regularly wish you well. You'll feel like a ""balla"" :). Limo pickup is terrific and spoils you - you'll get one pickup and drop-off (2 if you are in the 2 bedroom suite). Note - the taxis will not enter the SkySuites entrance. You'll need to walk around the corner for that. 2. As others have said, the concierge lounge is extremely convenient, especially during a week where the temperatures hit 116. Lounge hosts were unerringly polite and worked hard to keep the goodies stocked. 3. Aesthetics and comfort at Aria has always been a selling point, I think my blood pressure drops the moment I enter the place. Believe it or not. 4. Location is better than competing high-end places like Wynn and Palazzo, at least for the places we wanted to see. It just so happened that Queen's show was that weekend, just a stone's throw away at T-Mobile Arena. The concierge helped my guests grab some tickets at the last minute! 5. The restaurant game has improved considerably. My friends and I loved Carbone, Five50, and Herringbone! Many of us are from Austin, Texas, which is quite the foodie town. Yes, the prices are going to be a bit above what other cities have but that's to be expected. Other outstanding places are nearby Aria in City Center. No need to hike very far. 6. Aria SkySuites may have updated some of the technology like the in-room iPad-like controls. We liked the concierge texting feature and the ability to order food for pickup from the tablet. 7. The Skypool and cabanas. Less crowded, chaotic, and how can the servers possibly keep smiling all day after 116 degree temps! 8. The two bedroom penthouse layout is outstanding. It seems like it it often a better deal than trying to get two adjacent corner suites + standard rooms at the Aria Tower. Overall...a special 50th. The bad (and only to be fair)... 1. Others have mentioned this too but some guests get a little carried away with the weed. We're not prudes but come on, I'd rather smell coffee than doobies in the morning. 2. Housekeeping needs to be more careful. They left our room unlocked (confirmed by management, who remedied the problem to our great satisfaction). They will scoop up stuff we thought we would keep (some souvenirs). They left some items from previous guests in drawers (including something called ""Turkish Delight""). 3. Starting to have a little wear and tear in the furnishings according to some friends (I didn't notice, myself). 4. The legendary Toko washlet kind of malfunctioned while I was on it. Let's just say, it was funny wondering how to turn it off without getting off of it and making a mess :). Bottom line is, I really appreciate the Aria staff and concierge in making this trip special. Kudos!",5,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Holy cow! The check in was horrible.

They assume people add sugar and that would hide the taste. I didn't add sugar. The oats were old or whatever butter they added... I called dining service to tell them and the ignorant lady told me: ""perhaps u never had Irish oatmeal"" Um...this oatmeal, Irish or not, is expired. Period. That taste and smell isn't normal. It smelled funny too!!!! My husband requested a newspaper and they collected a discarded paper and handed it to him!!! Sky suites: 900+ per night really. They're sick here.",2,0
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","From the moment I was picked up at the airport by the Limo driver, until we were dropped off by an even bigger limo (with a cooler driver), the Aria Sky suites exceeded expectations. My husband surprised me for my birthday with a trip to Vegas, and arrived the night earlier. Upon arrival I was whisked into the private check in area where the service was top notch. This area also is where the private Lounge is located, complete with cozy blue velvet sofas and snacks. During the evening they host a cocktail reception for Sky Suite guests. When I walked down the hallway to my room, I certainly felt it was very much looking like the Vdara where I had stayed a few months earlier. When I entered the suite I was met with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, and a note from my husband. I looked around and was suitably impressed. The suite was large and airy. It had floor to ceiling windows, a half bathroom, dining table, sofa, desk and iPad remotes to control everything. The music Chanel's offered a really good selection of Chanel's and I found a metal one that stayed on the majority of my trip. The bedroom was Separated by a doorway. The king size bed was the most comfy bed ever ! The highlight was the stand alone whirlpool tub with champagne steam bubbles that caresses your entire body. It was big enough for 2 which made it lots of fun ( being a newly wed ). That was in December. We came back for my husbands birthday end of February. Sadly, the service the second time around left much to be desired, but our suite this time was in one of the Penthouses and it was even more amazing! Everything was big, bright, clean and I LOVED it ! The bathroom was so big with floor to ceiling windows on 2 sides. The jacuzzi bathtub was once again so full of bubbles I couldn't even see my husband ! We had a blast ! The suite itself was so big I wrapped up all his birthday gifts and hid them all over for a fun scavenger hunt. I also filled it with balloons. It was a birthday to remember! The bed had a huge cool white leather headboard and again was the best mattress I have ever slept on ( when we did actually sleep! ) The iPad remotes took care of all the room controls, music, TV, and you can order everything from them, from room service to booking your spa treatments. The Sky suites also gives you access to the Sky pool as well as the other Aria pool. We had fun as we were the only people at the Sky pool, I think there was a 3 to 1 ratio on staff vs guests. Staff was friendly at the pool area. They provide huge towels and have water, sunscreen and after sun lotion all available. The casino is nice and upscale. Not overly smoke filled. The cocktail waitress we had on our last day was very cool. She brought me the most amazing frozen mojitos ever ! And kept them coming without me having to ask. Not sure how much it costs here as it was courtesy of Mlife platinum, but If you get a chance, totally stay at the Sky Suites ! You won't be disappointed!",5,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","A must stay if you want luxury and relaxation. This was my first time in Vegas and I cannot imagine a hotel any better. We were picked up by our super friendly limo driver. It was a stretch Cadillac with lights that hit the concrete when they opened your door. The limo was stocked with figi water just for the short ride from the airport. The Skye Suites have a separate back entrance from the main casino and hotel entrance. As soon as we stepped out of the limo the bell man was right there waiting. We checked in with no issues and took the private set of elevators to our suite in the 34th floor. The elevator was manned by security requiring you to show you room key. Everytime you passed a staff member they greeted you and asked about your stay. Loved their attentiveness. The two bedroom suite was magical. Everything was ""smart"" in the room. The tablet opened the shades, controlled the TV, you could order food and book salon appointments. We went for a wedding and the chapel was dainty and had two Suites for the wedding party. They served mimosas for the guests as well. Of course during my stay I had to check out the private pool for the Skye Suites. They greeted me with water and prepared my lounge chair with a cover and monogrammed suite towels. I ordered a cocktail and felt so refreshed while enjoying their private pool. I really appreciated the daily fresh flowers and the enormous flower wall heading into the lobby. I plan to come back and when I do I will be staying at the Aria Sky Suites.",5,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","My husband and I had a few bumps with Aria in general last year. That being said our last few visits were pretty good. The sky suites is apparently the best you can get here. And it was outstanding. The service from the front desk crew to the housekeeper who took care of our room was beyond reproach. They had a lounge where you could relax and get tea, coffee, an assortment of juices and soft drinks and light snacks throughout the day. Wine and cheese was offered later on in the early evening. The room was spectacular, although we had stayed in a corner suite in the sky tower and I thought that room was actually much nicer albeit smaller. I was almost able to leave a five star rating if it weren't for the limo service. The limo that picked us up was dirty and run down. That was disappointing. The worse was the limo leaving. It was beautiful and clean. Exactly what you would expect. What I didn't expect was this, I put my camera equipment and $5000.00 Chanel carry on carefully in the front seat with the driver as I had a lot of luggage and didn't want those two bags put into the trunk. When we got to the airport either the bell hop, or the driver stuck my roll on carry on luggage right on top of my Chanel!! I was mortified, the wheels scuffed up a bag that was in brand new condition!!!!! I was livid and asked the driver why they did that. His replay was "" sorry, I didn't do that and I know how expensive your bag is"". You were sitting right next to it why didn't you move it off my bag? I don't know if Chanel can do anything to fix it, but come on people, you have clients that carry high end luggage you need to be more responsible with our property. Just when I thought we had a near perfect visit to this property this happens. I",4,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Nice Hotel, overpriced. Rooms are great, but overpriced for what the casino has to offer.

Nice shopping across the way.",2,0
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Recently stayed in the sky suites for my birthday. We had the Aria Suite. One bedroom, 52nd floor, strip view.

Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","This is my second time staying at the Sky Suites and I thought it was time to give a review. I really don't think there is any way to put into words how great the Sky Suites really are-everything-from the suite, to the customer service is always top notch. The suite is perfect appointed and in keeping with what you would expect from a high level resort. The room support staff does an excellent job from maid service to turn down service to room service. They all go above and beyond to make sure your stay is perfect. One particular shout out should go to Christopher, the Concierge for the Sky Suites. He is fantastic. From meeting my limo at the portico, to escorting me to the suite, to getting us tickets to see Cher at the last minute. Christopher is what customer service and making you feel special is all about. When we go to Vegas, we want to make it special and get that extra special service and treatment and the Sky Suites have always come through with flying colors. Aria is our go to place to stay in Vegas.",5,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","The Aria Sky Suites is truly a beautiful hotel. However, there were a few things that happen to me personally that were big disappointments. Lets start with the first one, my iPhone was stolen on their property. Security did absolutely nothing. Had I known while waiting for them 45 minutes that it was just to tell me ""sorry"" I would have just gone with my day and not wasted my time. I had to replace it $700 - so yes I am deeply upset about this and they did not offer me anything but a hey were sorry this happen. Fail.... Second, no one called me to pick me up at the airport. I called from the airport and had to tell them to pick me up. That was also a major fail on their end. Third, I forgot my black pumps in the room $250 BCBG Maxazria- I called lost and found to see if they were turned in and NOPE they were not. They have a serious problem with THEFT at the ARIA. I paid over $2K for two nights so yeah I'm pretty P.O, about this. Still with all those major defects why did I leave 4 stars? Because the room and service were absolutely amazing. Check in was a breeze- We stayed at the panoramic penthouse suite 39th floor. We were given champagne for my 40th bday, Aria champagne glasses, and a box of chocolates. Our room view was to die for!!! What a gorgeous room. The bathroom was outrageous and the toiletries were ridiculously luxurious. We had housekeeping twice a day- In the morning and evenings they offer coffee and muffins etc... and happy hour- wine cheese etc... High end snacks. They truly go out of their way to give you the star treatment. Even though I had some pretty upsetting things happen, I cannot not mention all the wonderful things they are doing right. I just wish they would of cared a bit more about my things being stolen.... I would stay again, just not be so trusting of my things not being taken.",4,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel",I absolutely love the sky suites. We stayed here last year for our anniversary in a 2 bedroom penthouse. I was able to stay here again for my birthday thanks to my wonderful husband. The rooms are large but the bathrooms are HUGE. The bedrooms are identical and come with a steam shower and a jetted tub. It doesn't even feel like you are in a hotel room. The bonus is the lounge area where you can get drinks and snacks throughout the day (free) and then there is wine in the evening. Unfortunately I don't want to stay anywhere else except here but just can't afford it. It's a place you should experience atleast once.,5,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","The mark of a truly great hotel is how they handle problems when they inevitably arise. Aria sky suites is a truly great hotel. We were lucky enough to upgrade into a sky suite room on a recent trip to Vegas. Long time Four Seasons fans, we were expecting to be underwhelmed. We most assuredly were not. Everything about Aria Sky Suites is understated elegance. But the real test of their mettle came when our daughter received a midnight phone call from housekeeping demanding to know who she was and why she was occupying the room. Of course we went straight to the front desk. Though no one on the hotel staff could believe that anyone from the hotel would make such a call at that time of night, security got right to work and tracked it down. It was a clerical error over another guest making a room change. All was well. But the hotel staff went out of their way to make it up to us. Good job Sky Suites security and front desk staff!",5,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","This was indeed a fabulous hotel to stay at. I booked it being my birthday bc last year I woke up sick with a slight hangover. Now you know why I don't like to drink bc I'm a frickin' lightweight! It was our first time and I read from other people's reviews that they have a complimentary limo ride to and from the airport which really isn't that far away from the Strip. It's not highly advertised so I strongly recommend you ask about it. If you don't rent a car and expect a limo ride everywhere you go it's an additional hundred bucks. We used Lyft instead! Yay! We got here too early as checkin is at three in the afternoon. They were kind enough to check our luggages in so we could venture out! In their lobby area they served continental breakfast with coffee, hot water, bottled water, mineral water plus bottles of orange juice & grape juice and soda also provided. I think they served this between six and ten in the morning. We did stay in the one bedroom penthouse suite! It was breathtakingly beautiful! Reminded me of the Haven on NCL! YAY!!! So much is provided that all you need is your makeup, hairbrush and clothing. There was a separate refrigerator plus the refrigerator stocked full of many items. At the end we checked with our charges bc they kept saying we purchased chocolate. Like what? Even two different hotel receptionists said that! I checked my credit card and there were four different pending charges. OMGOSH 100 bucks for chocolate? Plus double check that they have you scheduled for the limo ride back to the airport bc it can be lost in a moment's notice. Like a sieve! WTH??? They do serve complimentary wine and cheese from four to nine in the evening. It came in handy bc basically hubby and I don't eat a lot normally. We did eat at Aria Cafe which opens 24/7 plus it was Restaurant week too! The room had spectacular views with windows that were floor to ceiling even in the humongous bathroom! When the butler dropped off our luggages he showed me the iPads in both the living room & a second one in the bedroom. They have information to help you with your stay there. Everything is controlled with separate switches. It took a little while for us to figure it out things though we are technologically challenged we did manage! Overall a gorgeous, modern and classy hotel. This is a private area of Aria that you need a key to show security to get through it. It basically is connected to the Aria hotel and casino. You know what we will definitely be back but not during the summer. It was almost 110 each day!!! That's cray cray!!!",4,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I stayed there 2 years ago during the Magic convention when all other hotels were completely booked! Something I would never expect of Las Vegas. Interiors are great, service is amazing, price for stay was very reasonable. I like that Aria is very modern. Will definitely be back!",5,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Aria Sky Suites is what luxury and top notch service is all about. It starts with the private limo service from the airport and just gets better. You are treated like royalty the whole way. There is a separate entry into the hotel for Sky Suites guests, and even the check-in process is very tailored to your stay. The suites are spectacular - nothing short of perfection. There was not a single detail that was overlooked. The Sky Suites beds and pillows were also so comfortable that I even considered buying one for my home! (which Aria happens to sell...) And the giant oversized standalone jetted tub - need I say more? The reception area was always stocked throughout the day with refreshments and snakcs including great desserts from the hotel bakery -as well as an assortment of chocolate covered strawberries in the evenings. The star of the stay though, of all things, was housekeeping! Multiple refreshes during the day and a great turndown service. They always arrange and tidy up all loose articles, even folding your clothes for you. I can't say I didn't put out a few extra articles of clothing for fun - to find them all folded neatly and stacked on the dresser. :) Aria Sky Suites is my hotel of choice anytime I am ever in Las Vegas.",5,1

Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Sky suites is actually a small hotel inside Aria hotel, the entrance is different, there is no casino and smoke in this entire area. We flew in this time so they arranged complimentary limo services for us, it was sufficient and professional. Second time staying at Aria sky suites, penthouse was AMAZING, panoramic views, spacious living, dining and bedroom, bathroom with beautiful views too. The shower is also a steam room, if you don't want to go to the spa, this steam room will do too. Had late night room service, food was so yummy, the chicken noodle soup was particularly good, especially after binge drinking for an entire night! I really liked the sky suites lounge, they have finger food, wines and beverages all day everyday, very convenient for sky suites guests. There is a sky pool now, it is definitely more private and quiet, much better than regular pools. Again the location of the sky suites is the best, three fine dining restaurants right next to the second floor entrance. Other two Asian restaurants are close to first floor entrance. Pool, spa, salon and gym are on the sky suites side too. So I didn't have to walk much during the entire stay, my feet were very happy! Service was the best among the best of course, concierge was always patient and helpful. I guess this is how we Vegas, and it's so much fun yet still so comfortable and relaxing!",5,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Service was better here than at any other hotel i have been to in Las Vegas. Granted, I have only been to the Wynn, Encore, Bellagio, and Mirage resorts. However, I think I have a good cross-section of experience to make an informed opinion. The limo had that new car smell that is always so inviting, and there was complimentary Fiji water inside. The chauffeur was discreet and polite. If you stay at the Sky Suites, a limo picks you up and takes you to the airport. Bell service was very pleasant and accommodating. No line checking in....there was a party in front of us, but the wait was minimal. You know what those lines are like at the other hotels with people trying to snake you out. The front desk took care of check-in and check-out, and provided concierge service and general information. Maybe I wax on, but they were well beyond polite and cordial-they were open and caring, and genuinely wanted to help, it seemed like. There is a lounge that you can self-serve coffee, fruit, and assorted baked goods. In the evening wine is served. The lounge closes somewhere near midnight, but you can help yourself to fruit juices, carbonated drinks, and bottled water at any time. They clean up after you, too. We only rode the elevator once with other guests...the hotel did not seem very full. The room was nice, but not different from any other typical Aria room. However, maid service was very good. Linens, towels, and all toiletries (there were a few extra items) were always changed. The bed was turned down nightly with assorted chocolates on the pillows. What was not to like? Restaurants in the hotel are very pricey for what you get. There is no club in the hotel, but the Cosmo is just next door. It is actually a blessing because there is no thudding bass at 3:00 am to keep you up as there is at the Wynn. All things come to an end. It's back to reality and making enough money to do this all again! What an experience! What a vacation!",5,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Stayed March 2013 My husband & I booked a room at the Aria hotel & casino for our honeymoon. We had read that if you tip the person at check in $20, they sometimes upgrade you. My husband tried it, and it worked! They upgraded us to the sky suites!!! It was an amazing experience. The first night they leave you a plate with chocolate covered strawberries for when you come back. There is room service twice a day. If you need anything all you have to do is hit th VIP button on the phone & they are more than willing to help you with whatever you need,promptly! You have your own area to check in & out which saves you time at the front desk in case they are busy. After we got back home we found out that if you stay in the sky suites they offer a limo to & from the airport. They do not advertise this so make sure you ask about it. It is off the stip a little but it is easy to get to the stip if you go through Crystals or the Monte Carlo.The beds were amazing & as soon as our heads hit the pillow we were out like a light. If we ever make it back to Vegas we plan on staying at the Aria again!",5,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","What an amazing experience I had here. Everything is on point, attention to details are crazy. An awesome way to go when staying in Vegas...pricey but worth it.",5,1
Aria Sky Suites,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Stayed here for the first time on 7/12/15 while rolling in for just an overnighter. Upon arrival, we were told we were upgraded to a penthouse as our one bedroom suite was unavailable. We did find it odd that the ""penthouse"" was on the 25th floor...in a 61 floor hotel. It also didn't match any of the floor plans that represented penthouses. Oh well. It was still better than the room we were booked for. And it was NICE. I would live there if I could afford it. But I would upgrade the furniture, as the couch in the living room is designed for interrogation rooms. The bed though...oh yes. I am THE pickiest man on Earth when it comes to beds and my only complaint was ""well, it is a bit too firm."" I slept. I never sleep in Vegas unless it's on the couch. And if you like the bed, you can actually buy it from them and it's pretty reasonable in cost. The bathroom was just amazing. His and her vanities with separate bath amenities. Awesome tub. High-speed toilet with heated seat and bidet functions. Just fantastic. The worst? The aforementioned couch was a medieval torture device. The vaunted touch screen control for all the room's curtains, lighting, etc. was ATTACHED at the night stand. Not exactly the high-tech solution when you're anywhere but on one side of the bed. Oh, and the television, which controls EVERYTHING, went out for several hours. Thanks a lot for that. Customer service was generally awesome, from the front desk to the housekeeping. The lounge was a little over-named, as it's just a couple couches and tables thrown in a lobby. If you want a real concierge lounge try Palazzo. But they do serve snacks for most of the day and there is water, juice, soda, etc. available pretty much 24 hours. Ever come back to the room at midnight and wish you had a Coke but don't want to pay three bucks at the all-night store? Hit the lounge. My biggest complaint with the Sky Suites is that you get a private entrance...which is a pain in the behind to get to if you don't come by limo (which is complimentary to and from the airport). They have a special entrance for that, but if you drive into town like we did and go to the valet, you get to lug your stuff halfway across creation to get to the registration desk. It would be nice if they had a drive up entrance for Sky Suites...or a shuttle! Oh, and the buffet is far overpriced for what you get and the casino feels like an afterthought. We hit Vegas several times a year and generally, the Four Seasons is our favorite by far, but Aria Sky Suites is a very close second, and in some ways it's actually better. Four Seasons is quieter and has better (just barely) service, but Sky Suites has much more comfortable beds and that lounge with its drink supply is a Godsend. If you don't mind some minor niggles, Aria Sky Suites is a pretty decent place for the price for sure.",4,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","The experience from the beginning to end was great.

Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","This was the first time I ever went on a hot air balloon. It started with a guy named Earl. He was our driver and explained everything in a really fun, entertaining way. Randy, the balloonist, takes a lot of care and precision as far as determining where to start setting up so that he can guarantee a safe ride. This is the largest hot air balloon in the United States, and there were 20 people aboard. Even with that, Randy explained everything while we were up there, and we were even able to assist a little bit in the setup. It was one of the most entertaining and exciting days that I've had. I set this up for my husband and I as a birthday present to myself, and I was thrilled that we did this. The breakfast was good; everything about the day was perfect. I am saying all this even though I am not a morning person and had to be at the van by 6:30 a.m. which meant I had to get up at 5 a.m. Even with that, I highly highly recommend this company if you ever want to take a hot air balloon ride.",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","Arizona Balloon Safari's balloon is registered as the largest balloon in North America! It's twice as large and the other hot air balloons you see out there, so for people who complained about how long it took to find a launch point -- if you don't care about safety, go ahead use a different company. The wind is what steers the balloon and if I'm going to be floating a wicker basket, I want to make sure the company knows what it's doing!!! Our pilot Randy and his crew took a while to find the best launch spot -- but we flew during monsoon season so the winds were unpredictable. We were able to eventually find the perfect spot to take off, and when we did, I felt totally safe and reassured. Earl was our van driver and was awesome and hilarious. Randy was a terrific pilot and great air-tour guide with information on what we were flying over. After we landed, we had a fun champagne toast and were presented flight certificates after a yummy breakfast. Totally worth the cost in my opinion, even without the groupon we used! Highly recommend Randy, Earl and crew for you flight. You will be in expert care and have a great time.",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","Apparently the weather was great...we drove out to the take off area, got to help set up the balloon, we got to go inside of the balloon while it being blown up to take some pictures. The ride was super smooth and the pilot was great. All the staff are fantastic. We got Champaign and a delicious breakfast as well. Everything was perfect!",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","The negative reviews are misleading, read the website before booking, even if you don't do that, all the information is relayed to you as soon as you get in the van. There are no surprises and the crew is super friendly and helpful. First: the website specifically states you will not see the sunrise Second: the website also says that the direction of the balloon cannot be controlled except by wind so they may have to drive around to a couple spots before picking a take-off location We met in a Safeway parking lot where vans drove us to the first spot, immediately we were informed that we may have to stop at a couple spots before deciding on one. We were lucky enough that the first spot was good, set up took about an hour (again we were informed of this first thing) due to the fact that it's the largest balloon in north America and thus takes longer than most others would take to set up. Throughout the process the crew lets you get involved if wanted but does not require it but they are CONSTANTLY offering to take pictures of you with the balloon (I'm a photo freak so I really appreciated this) Before it was fully set up they let you get inside the balloon part to see and take pictures (& they offer to take some of you of course!) Flight was about 45-60 minutes which is exactly what the website says. & other balloons did go higher than us but not by much, again largest balloon in North America meaning a lot of extra weight meaning it can't go as high. A big baby like me was fine with that but if you're not then book with someone else Beautiful to see and Randy kept us entertained the whole time and was even pointing out different land marks Landing was rough but Randy made it fun and the crew was there waiting with vans and breakfast, we ate while they put the balloon away The ceremony was weird but cute, if you don't want to participate in it then don't. Vans drove us back to the parking lot and we left. Great experience with a great crew, I really appreciated that the crew kept offering to take pictures of us & kept making us laugh.",5,1

The breakfast was light, yet filling and went great with our Mimosa's. I would do this ride again and recommend it to anyone thinking about it.",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","What a great Experience! Incredibly competent and professional crew and pilot who were very personable. I had no idea this was the largest balloon in North America - 11 stories high and the there were 22 of us on the ride. It did take longer to inflate the balloon but the staff worked seamlessly together and described the process. I was very impressed in that both the captain Randy, who obviously loves piloting the balloon, and staff, have flown all over the world in hot air balloons. The staff is so hard working and at landing, in the middle of the desert, put tarps on the plants to protect the cactus. They had a respect for the desert environment and I certainly appreciated that. (Of course cactus and balloons don't go together!) I definitely would recommend this company for their emphasis on safety, education, and the incredibly hard working staff. They were all genuinely working to ensure we had a great time. It was nice to spend a morning with people who sincerely want to make sure you have an enjoyable experience.",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","Amazing experience! This company did a wonderful job! Yes you get up early and go out with the crew to find a spot, then watch them set up the balloon so it takes some time before you are in the air. The crew is very fun, experienced, friendly, and let you know whats going on every step of the way. The ride was beautiful and peaceful. The pilot is very experienced. We were in the air for a while - over 50 min. Then you land and have a nice champagne toast and breakfast. They even put a happy birthday banner on the basket for me and a happy anniversary banner for another couple. I would highly recommend this experience with THIS COMPANY! They rock and you will love it.",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","We had to get up early and be there by 5am, which was okay, but we didn't get to see the sunrise from the balloon because the set up took a very long time. It was neat to see the balloon being blown up, but the ride itself was probably only 40 minutes long and we didn't go nearly as high as all the other balloons in the air (not to mention we barely cleared some of the power lines). After we landed they did a weird balloon champagne ceremony and breakfast that took way too long. Overall, it was okay but I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. Their process is really slow and could have been ran a lot smoother and the ride itself should have been longer and flown way higher.",2,0
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","I bought this hot air balloon ride for my mother's birthday. It was very expensive and I expected a lot out of it.

While we saw other hot air balloons in the sky looking at the sunrise, it took the crew three attempts to even find a spot where the wind was OK. This took quite some time. Eventually the crew ended up picking a spot where 5 other hot air balloons were preparing for take-off. We wondered why this couldn't have been considered in advance. 6.40 am was the time we took off in the hot air balloon. We had missed the sunset (which was one of the reasons I chose this activity) and the ride itself was only 40 minutes. It was a beautiful scenery but not quite what we had expected as it wasn't in the sunrise and very quick. When we got down a champagne breakfast was offered. The champagne was good, but the choice of food was odd with eggs, strawberries, cinnamon rolls and even more pastries. The crew was very friendly but the hot air balloon experience itself was honestly disappointing. It felt rushed and unorganized. Having read previous reviews about the hot air balloon not getting off in time to see the sunrise, the people organizing this might want to take this into consideration in the future as quite a few people have expressed their disappointments!",2,0
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","What a wonderful adventure!! We got to stand INSIDE this humongous balloon while it was being filled. It is the largest balloon in the USA and there are no others as large. There were 20 people on this ride and it was very comfortable. I have a fear of heights and thought this would take all my courage to do. But oddly enough, there was no fear at all it is so quiet and peaceful gliding along in the sky.... No fear. There was a cute champagne ceremony afterward and a breakfast. The crew were amazing. Prompt, courteous, made it interesting and very enjoyable. I highly recommend this company.",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel",Amazing time. Great staff. Wonderful experience. Well worth it. Largest balloon in the US. Amazing time to fly. Went March 2016. Perfect time.,5,1

Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","Yesterday was my boyfriends birthday and I surprised him with a hot air balloon ride. I hate airplanes and am very afraid of heights so I have no idea why I decided to go along but I am SO GLAD I did! The experience was one of a kind. It felt like floating, there was nothing rough or scary and the ENTIRE staff was so kind. The pilot would tell stories and point out interesting things but it wasn't too much or distracting from the experience. You can tell they go above and beyond in everything they do. It was well worth the money and I plan on going again.",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","I highly recommend this experience !! Yes, it was such a complete experience! Our friends gave this ride as a gift and it was perfect! We had to check in at 4.45 am and the super friendly crew took us to a launching spot. Now, you gotta be a lil patient here because it takes some time to find a good launching spot ( wind condition etc). So please be patient ( there were a couple of silent whiners around us). The crew is experienced, friendly and very good. They know what they are doing. So trust them and enjoy this awesome ride!",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","Very well thought out and well organized trip. Started at the Safeway parking lot at 4:45AM. From there, hunting for a good launching spot given the wind conditions took about an hour. Then the ride lasted about two hours covering more than five miles and rising up to about 2000 ft. And after landing a little south of the outlets at Anthem in the middle of the desert, we were given a nice champagne breakfast + adorable ceremony + a neat lil certificate! Amazing views of the Arizona landscape at sunrise. Wonderful crew. I would definitely recommend this for anyone visiting the valley.",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel",Had a great flight and the crew did wonderfully even if the flight didn't go as planned. It was a very long day for our group and more of a bonding experience than anyone counted on lol! I didn't catch his name but one young guy went out of his way for the entire group to get water and it was really appreciated. The ownwr is fantastic and a true professional. Thanks you guys. All terrain ballooning!,5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","We selected Arizona Balloon Safaris to celebrate our friends birthday. We were picked up at the designated meeting point. We drove to different locations as they were gauging the winds before deciding on a launch point near Lake Pleasant. It was obvious that to the crew, the safety and enjoyment of their guests were of primary importance. It was interesting to watch the balloon preparation. Again, watching the crew secure cables, attach the burner and shield unit etc. you can tell that safety is a priority. The flight was fantastic, with the pilot providing explanations and injecting humor as he explained the history of balloon flight, and specifics of the balloon. Breakfast was provided, while they broke down the balloon and prepped it for storage and the next flight. Again, their knowledge and expertise made the entire experience enjoyable.",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","My wife purchased a flight as birthday gift. This was our first experience in a balloon and we had a great time. The pilot and crew were both courteous and professional. Randy was very knowledgeable and added light humor throughout the ride. Overall I would say it met our expectations...it didn't fall below and didn't surpass. The reason for the drop in one star...the price was a little on the high side and we had to pull over a couple of times to get wind speed/directional readings, which delayed the flight. If someone could have gotten the readings and scouted the location ahead of us, we may have been able to launch as the sun was rising. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and we'll take our son on the next trip!",4,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","This was my first balloon ride experience and a must given it was on my bucket list. I used a Groupon for myself, my stepmom and we also had a friend who bought one So there were three of us in total in our party. We arrived promptly at 6 AM on March 15th, at our meeting point in the Safeway parking lot in Cave Creek, Arizona. Very shortly thereafter we were on our way to the launch site. You are invited to participate in the set up but only if you want to, otherwise you are free to step back and take the whole thing in. Randy, the pilot and his crew of four were absolutely fantastic, professional, funny and super informative. My dad went along to take pics and the crew quickly adopted him in the process. There was not a single point in time where we felt unsafe or had any concerns whatsoever. The process was explained well. We had no expectations that we would have a ton of room in the basket just given the fact that those baskets aren't very big. Space was appropriate given the nature of the adventure. The launch site chosen was a popular one for other balloon companies. We did not feel crowded though. The views of the desert were pretty however I wouldn't say it is as picturesque as Sedona or Flagstaff; however certainly worthy of enjoyment and photos. Our landing was issue free and the whole process fascinating. Randy the Pilot is excellent at what he does and readily answers any questions you have. He also has a way of just knowing when conversation is not needed. I would highly recommend this company and really loved the staff....it was a great first time experience! Thanks Arizona Balloon Safaris... you did a great job with the ride, the blessing after, the light breakfast and of course the transport to and from. One more thing... Bring your camera as Randy and the crew are happy to take pics!",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","My husband and I went on our first Hot Air Balloon ride today with Arizona Balloon Safaris. It was a surprise for me as a 30th birthday present. It was the coolest experience ever. I am afraid of heights but have always wanted to do this. The owner/pilot Randy explained everything and made me feel so much better about the ride. Seeing the entire process from the balloon being put together, blown up, the ride and then the landing and breaking down of the balloon was really cool. The ride was peaceful and beautiful and Randy was full of fun knowledge. He talked about Hot Air Balloons facts and pointed out things like lake pleasant, the shooting range and the Cardinals arena. When it was over we had a champagne breakfast with the other riders. It was really nice. I would recommend this to everyone to at least try once in their lifetime with AZ Balloon Safaris. The friendly crew and fun pilot made for a very memorable day. Thanks AZ Balloon Safaris",5,1
Arizona Balloon Safaris,"Tours, Hotels & Travel","Arizona Balloon Safaris is the worst. My balloon got cancelled due to rain. There was no rain on Sunday. I was treated with disrespect by the owner and when asked about rescheduling, was told ""I have openings in mid April"". I told him that was unreasonable, as I reserved the ride at the very beginning of Feb, and he hung up on me. I definitely recommend not wasting your time on a company that has that little respect for its customers.",1,0
Auberge De La Place Royale,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","We got a great deal on the hotel because it was off season and at first I was worried about staying here because of the price but I am so glad we booked it. It's in the heart of old Montreal, right across from the pier. Parking wasn't terrible, we parked at the science museum lot at 25$CAD for every 24 hours. Everything about this hotel was so delightful thanks to all the little details. It's a small, local place so there's no breakfast but you're in the heart of old Montreal so do yourself a favor and grab a croissant and coffee at a local cafe. There is no elevator, so be mindful of booking. We chose to stay on the top floor for a good view but there were some nights going up 4 flights of stairs seemed like the hardest thing to accomplish. Staff was very friendly and although there is no one at the desk 24/7, they have a call line open 24/7 and are very helpful. The rooms are a lot bigger than I expected for it being in old Montreal and extremely clean. I seriously loved everything about this hotel and have already decided we are not staying anywhere else but here when we go back to visit Montreal. The location is perfect, you can walk to Notre Dame because it is literally 2 blocks away and all of the restaurants you can drewam off. Downtown was about a 15 min walk too.",5,1
Auberge De La Place Royale,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","This was a great property in the heart of Old Port / Old Montreal - two blocks away from the basilica which is great. Easily accessible to all forms of public transportation and great sightseeing in the area. Close to attractions such as Bota Bota, Montreal eye, Old Port, so on and so forth. Oozing with old world charm. Impeccably clean. No fault of the Auberge, but the building was built in the 1800s so it creaked loudly. You can hear your neighbors come in and out. There is a club that plays loud music on Saturday night but was silent on Sunday and Monday, so that was fine. My only advice is to make sure you request a higher level room (3rd floor is best so you have no one above you!). Lastly, the bed and pillows were a bit firm which wasn't to my taste but my fiance liked it!",4,1
Auberge De La Place Royale,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Cute hotel with friendly staff. It's quaint and perfect for couples and is a great location. The reason for the three stars is because parking is horrendous. It took us 3 1/2 hours to find parking even though it said to park at the science museum, they blocked it off. Also, we bought a water view room and received a side of a building view. We would stay again if we could get parking right away and got the room we paid for.",3,0

Auberge De La Place Royale,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","This is a very quaint and charming 12 room hotel that is very suitable for couples. Children are welcome and the larger rooms has a couch and there are toys for them to play with. It is owned and operated by a young couple and true to european style service values (come on you are in old montreal) they strive hard to make the stay enjoyable. Its very homey and home comforts abound and is well suited to those not looking for a Marriott experience. No pool, gym or sauna but bikes are available for free use A Mac with internet access and a printer is available for printing off tourist stuff or boarding passes and 3 guitars available for strumming. Forget an umbrella ...no problem they have them A well stocked mini bar is priced so you can enjoy consumption and not worry about a hefty tab at the end of the stay. Antiques and rustic exposed brick abound and offers a wonderful charm to your experience and you are right in the old port and you cannot beat the location. Priced very well means its very much sold out so early check in or late check outs could be an issue and it s $40 cab ride to the airport",5,1
Auberge De La Place Royale,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","The room we got was pretty much a studio apartment. They had the sleeper sofa pulled out for us (the kids) and the bed was nice and firm. Bathroom was huge and nice. It's and old building, so there were patches taken out from the wall, but I'm not sure why. A/C is controlled by remote, and the wall control is for the heaters. We pretty much had them battling out overnight because we were dumb and didn't realize they were 2 different controls (found out on the way out because we couldn't figure out why the heaters were on). Fridge with beer and wine, milk, little boxes of cereal (costs extra). Coffee and tea in the rooms. Great location near the Vieux Port/Old Port area. Our host spoke excellent English. Very close to Notre Dame Basilica, as well. There are stairs to get to the rooms even on the ""first floor"" so look out. They have a computer and printer if you need to print out a boarding pass as well.",5,1
Auberge De La Place Royale,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","My boyfriend and I stayed at Auberge de la Place Royal for two nights and we absolutely loved it. It is right in the heart of Old Montreal and so many lovely bars and restaurants are within walking distance, as is the metro. The hotel is beautiful and warm, and our room welcomed us with a little chalkboard on the door with my name written on it. It felt romantic and cozy with the rustic furniture and exposed brick and the room even had a corkscrew and little cafe table! The wifi worked perfectly (which was great as our American cell phones didn't have service). Note: complimentary coffee was remarkably delicious.",5,1
Auberge De La Place Royale,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","My husband and I stayed here on our mini-moon and it was just wonderful. Our room was beautiful, with arm chairs, exposed brick and big windows. We walked practically everywhere (to lots of good food, so probably good that we walked) and it wasn't that hard to find free parking (we paid for parking for first night though). It was full of small touches, like a sign hanging on the door of our room to welcome us, maps and guidebooks for our use and even a guitar on the second floor for guests to use (we didn't but it's a nice thought). Montreal is a beautiful city full of charm and Auberge De La Place Royale is the perfect place to stay.",5,1
Auberge De La Place Royale,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Convenient location to visit all of Old Town (and Cirque tents were only a short walk away). Friendly and very helpful staff, large rooms with a lot of character and the mini-bar fridge was a nice plus. Rooms very noisy on alley side from late night partiers to very early am trash collection trucks, so ask for street side rooms and you'll get views, too. No elevator, but plenty of old world charm.",4,1
Auberge De La Place Royale,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel",I stayed at this wonderful old world inn July 2013. The service was wonderful and the large room was comfortable and well kept. The best is that it's right in the heart of Old Montreal and within walking distance of the best restaurants and sights. The owner also went out of her way after I left something in the right to work with me and make sure it was sent to me back in the US right away. Thank you!,5,1
Best Western Plus Sundial,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Hotels","I absolutely enjoyed my stay at the Best Western PLUS Sundial. The rooms are large and the beds are comfy, however, it was the service that set this hotel apart from others! I checked in after midnight due to weather flight delays and the front desk agent could tell I was really tired so he checked me in as swiftly as possible and was so kind the whole time. Offered me a bottle of water and said if I needed anything at all he would be on his shift overnight. *One note if you rent a car, pull up to the porte cochere to check in and they will give you a parking notice to park directly behind the building, where there is another entrance as well. The next morning I went down to check out the breakfast and I honestly was not expecting much but they had a wonderful display and offered hard boiled eggs, which happens to be my go to quick breakfast! The illy coffee was superb, as I have never had it before! It woke me right up...Starbucks..who? ILLY is the best! They even had sugar in the raw. I lucked out! When I returned from my day of meetings, the front desk agent was different and he not only greeted me but said he didn't know me and wanted to know who I was. He said he remembers everyone who checks in but said I must have checked in super late since he didn't remember my face. I introduced myself and he also offered me a bottle of water. The service was so friendly and warm and I felt a sense of security which was nice being a solo traveler. The location is phenomenal too! I am excited I have a ""go to"" hotel to stay when I visit Phoenix/Scottsdale again!",5,1
Best Western Plus Sundial,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Hotels","First, the good: the location is great--within easy walking distance of downtown Scottsdale, the mall, and plenty of awesome restaurants. The breakfast includes freshly cooked eggs and either bacon or sausage each morning. The employees were all very nice. The bad: it is directly across the street from the very popular (and VERY LOUD) W Hotel and outdoor pool party--which happened pretty much each day and night, which included plenty of police activity as well. The gym is tiny and not well equipped. The ugly: the beds are quite possibly some of the least comfortable I've ever slept on. The AC blows directly down on your face, no matter where you try to hide. And when you book through Expedia (or any other outside booking site) they do not honor your room type request--confirmed a King and got two queens instead. We definitely overpaid for the room and hotel type--but it was the last weekend of Spring Training and of Spring Break--so, I am sure the rooms across Scottsdale would be more reasonable at a different time.",2,0
Best Western Plus Sundial,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Hotels","The night we checked in it was 2am. I was really looking forward to a sun-filled weekend with my sister in Scottsdale and this hotel had really good reviews for a mid-level stay. I'd like to start by saying that the night manager the evening (2am) I checked in was absolutely wonderful. His name is Dino and his service was Ritz-Carlton worthy, hence the extra star, but that is really where the good-part of this stay stopped. At check-in. Our room was fine: 2 queen beds in a small, clean room with shutters on the windows (no black-out curtains) and shutters on the bathroom door (which, if you're staying with anyone but family or a spouse, is VERY strange). We slept well, because while it was loud outside, inside the room, with the door closed, was fine. They have a small pool that we used. It was clean and good. The next day, really same day as checkin, our key card timed out. Locked out of our room. We were promptly issued a new key. Okay, day continues. We have a WONDERFUL dinner and back to our hotel we go, to meet Ben, the security guard. Apparently, I did not enter the parking lot the correct way. Ben made sure to demeaningly tell me so. This was embarrassing and inappropriate. It could have easily been handled with class and a, ""I will open this entrance for you, but let me show you the entrance in the back so that in the future this doesn't happen to you again."" But instead, his attitude was just terrible and he, unapologetically, made sure to make me feel like a moron for being a non-local, making a simple mistake of entering in the wrong way because I did not remember a map given to me at 2am at check-in. I went to the check-in desk to discuss Ben's treatment of a guest, and while the night manager was apologetic, Ben the security guard followed me to the desk to listen to my complaint. The night manager saw he was there, but made no move to ask Ben to leave so that we might continue our conversation. Absolutely nothing was offered or done to remedy the experience for the duration of our stay. The entire event should never have happened. The next 2 days my keys expired daily, costing me several trips to the front desk to re-key. They were never by phone or magnets, and I was told when I brought them up, that they had expired. This was a really disappointing stay. Overall, because of poor service. I cannot recommend it. There are a myriad of hotels and I would recommend you look elsewhere because, regardless of hotel-level, good customer service is a must!",2,0

Best Western Plus Sundial,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Hotels",Stayed recently at this hotel and had a very bad experience. When we arrived the television didn't work and someone came up and took an hour to fix it. Finally got it to work. Then we went to sleep and realize that the heater didn't work and it was a cold night. We were uncomfortably cold through the night with extra provided blankets. That was fixed the following day. But the worst part of our stay was that I accidentally left a pair of $500.00 Armani dress shoes on the top shelf in the closet in our room and when we called the following day they were not able to find them. The manager was rude and belligerent making a comment that who would want or take an old man's pair of used shoes. He was very disrespectful. Don't stay at this hotel.,1,0

As far as the rooms, we booked a king bed. The bed was firm, the sheets nice and thick, very nice heavy pillows. The room was updated nice with a walk in shower and there were soap and shampoo dispensers on the wall in the shower. The art and decor in the room all modern and very nice. There was a free continental breakfast which I thought was gonna suck but it was really good. There was a hot station with country potatoes, scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, French toast, a vat of oatmeal with all the fixings to add, and lots more..Starbucks coffee was a plus too.

There is plenty of parking in the rear of the building and there are plenty of places to walk to for dinner/entertainment. I travel very often so the little things like size of tv are very important to me. While most hotels have a 32"" screen, this BW has a 42""! Great for playing PS4 and watching Netflix. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom and shower were extremely clean and modern. Every BW I have stayed at in the valley is great, with the exception of the BW Inn of Tempe.

Best Western Plus Sundial,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Hotels","I was here in October for an extended weekend with my hubby. I hadn't been to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and had no idea what to expect re locale or location. As it turns out, this hotel is ideally located to the Fashion Square Mall, Old Town Scottsdale, and the Entertainment district. We were greeted by Dino when we checked in and he was outstanding - he was so pleasant - he literally said to us "" when you are here - this is your home if there is anything you need just let us know"" great first impression. He was always very friendly and always went out of his way to help us. The hotel itself offers pretty much everything you need for a comfortable nights stay a reasonable price point. Free Wifi ( strong too ) free breakfast - hot and cold items, which was nice, a fitness room - with great equipment, ( including a fridge in there with free bottled water), and a pool with cabanas. Our room was located on the first floor and faced towards the parking lot - so subsequently we kept our shutters closed or we wouldn't have had the privacy we wanted, but that wasn't the problem of the hotel - we probably should have asked to move as soon as we checked in, but it really wasn't a big deal. The bed was really comfortable and the shower was nice. One thing there that I have never seen at any other hotel was that the shampoo, conditioner, and soap was on the wall in a pump dispenser. I actually thought it was kind of cool. From an environmental point of view, it's better, and you could easily dispense what you wanted. It definitely gave it a more budget feel, but it also made more sense. Some people have commented on the noise from the entertainment district across the road - and yes -its true -its crazy how loud it can be - a deep thumping bass.. but we found if the AC is on you didn't really hear it and we were facing the road, but I would imagine all you need to do is request a room near the back and you would be fine. All in all this hotel is a great property in terms of service, value for dollar and location in Scottsdale.",4,1
Best Western Plus Sundial,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Hotels","Best western plus sun dial in Scottsdale, az was decent in appearance the parking lot is so tiny and only one car per room is permitted. However, the staff-specifically ""Dino"" was unacceptable. He absolutely ruined what was supposed to be a night to remember for a bride to be. We were not drunk. We were not loud. There was a total of 13 of us and when we walked in the lobby coming from dinner, he immediately started reprimanding us for being there. I had bought 2 rooms and he said only 4 people per room- no guests can visit in your room. I tried to explain that they would not be staying, we just wanted to open gifts and have cake... while I was saying this he was talking over me and at me so I could not speak. I finally got in, ""may we use this common area to open gifts and eat cake?"" He said fine so I went upstairs to grab the presents and cake, on my way up one of the girls called me because he changed his mind. I came back down and he said he changed his mind and we needed to leave immediately or he would call the cops. I tried to ask why the change of mind but he again started talking over me. The bride asked, ""Sir, may we speak with you without you interrupting?"" and he said no. We asked to speak to a manager and he said he was the manager (his name tag said guest services). He then said we had 20 minutes to retrieve our things and leave. Again, we had not been drinking, we were respectful, and this was recorded on their surveillance video and I extremely hope it is reviewed! We were not a group of young 20 somethings. Half of us are moms, with a median age of 30. I had been planning this night for the past 6 months. I was in tears. The bride was in tears. It was an awful, awful experience. Some of the worst customer service I've ever had. I hate confrontation. I hate causing a scene. I've never done a review before, but I am so upset. Luckily, we explained our situation to Valley Ho and we got an amazing deal on their penthouse suite. Their customer service and just basic human social skills and compassion are outstanding. Highly, highly recommend them. Also, while figuring out this ordeal- the restaurant where we had dinner (Bootleggers American Smokehouse) took our group back in and let us bring in cake and open gifts and gave us all complimentary moonshine. This is how adults treat one another. This is how businesses thrive. Superior customer service and understanding. Dana and the staff at Bootleggers really saved the night and we are so greatful. None of us will ever be staying at a Best Western and we will be writing letters to this corporate office; as well as, finding every review site possible to spread the word. Dino should not be in this business and Best Western should be avoided unless you are looking to be scolded and treated like children... no not children, treated like inferior human beings. Oh! And after leaving the lobby and deciding our next course of action, another guest walked in to check in. We watched Dino through the doors point at us and use vigorous hand motions while speaking to the guests that were checking in. Extremely unprofessional and uncalled for. We left and obeyed his command, and he still felt the need to speak with other GUESTS about the situation.",1,0

Best Western Plus Sundial,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Hotels","Ok so I am comparing this to a best western and not the ritz Carlton! The place is not as lavish as you see in the pics. It's very small. But the rooms are cozy and it is PRIME location. You are walking distance to everything and across the street from the bars and nightclubs. The breakfast is above average for a continental breakfast and the staff is very nice. Convenient parking as well. The downside is the noise from the bar and nightclubs as well as the screaming drunk people that may interrupt your sleep. The pool is small and not relaxing. People r pretty loud. Basically if you want to party then it's a great spot but if your here for business or relaxing I highly suggest you go to a different spot. Another negative is the tv remote ( rarely works) and worst of all the internet. Don't even bother trying to use the wifi because you will get disconnected every time you click on a different page. The shower pressure is also not good at all. For the price and the fact that I'm young, and like the party scene, I would definitely come back again.",3,0
Best Western Plus Sundial,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Hotels","Stayed at this hotel for 5 days after moving here to Phoenix. Nice location in Scottsdale. It is a very clean hotel, has nice rooms. It can get a little loud outside on the weekends from across the street, but I haven't noticed inside the rooms. The pool is only 5 feet deep in the center, but I still enjoyed it and the hot tub. Above all I would have to say the staff is the one thing about this hotel that shines the most. I would rate the hotel as a strong 4, but cannot give it less than 5 because of the staff. They are very friendly, eager to help and always polite. The longer we stayed the more impressed we were. Helping us to find a place to park a moving truck with trailer was nice, and the hotel Manager making sure to catch us later to fix our parking job and prevent a ticket was even better. From the hassle we had in moving, the drive, and having to find a different apartment, this place was the one problem we didn't have. Wrote review 8/14",5,1

Best Western Plus Sundial,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Hotels",As a gold elite Best Western Rewards member my wife and I earned a free night and chose to stay at this hotel because we previously had a good experience. During our previous visit we noted that the jacuzzi feature on the bathtub was not working in the room we were assigned and the staff was very helpful and upgraded our room to the sky suite which was phenomenal. During this visit we were assigned one of the standard suites and after checking in the first thing we checked was the jacuzzi feature on the bathtub to see if it was working. We found it once again to be malfunctioning and quickly reported the issue to the front desk. The front desk employee apologized and said that he would check to see if the sky suite was available. He ran up to the room and noted that it was available but that he would not be able to give it to us due to the A/C not being turned on yet in the room. I informed him that we would be willing to wait for the room to be ready but he said that he would not allow that. Instead we were assigned an even smaller room than the one we originally had. The front desk clerk told me that he would leave a note for management(who had gone home for the day) to inform them of our issue and that management might be willing to credit us with another stay. During the remainder of our stay I noted several other issues such as outlets not working in our room as well as the vending machine being out of stock of regular coca-cola and and another vending machine completely out of order. The next morning I went to the front desk to see if I could speak to a manager about the issues we had the previous day and the clerk told me that management would not be in for another 30 minutes. I was unable to wait so I recapped the events of the previous evening for the clerk and he assured me that management would either contact me by phone or email me regarding the issues my wife and I experienced. It has now been 6 days since we stayed at this location and I have not been contacted by any member of management in any way. I am very displeased with the level of customer service this time around after having such an enjoyable experience during my previous visit. As a gold elite rewards member this is extremely disheartening and really makes me have doubts about staying at another Best Western.,1,0

CLS Las Vegas,"Limos, Hotels & Travel, Transportation, Airport Shuttles","10 negative stars. I was picked up by CLS shuttle form Mandalay Bay going to the airport on 7/13/2012 at 3:50pm. A young lady and I were the only passengers, she and I had one single carry-on luggage each. The young black driver was speeding from the start. As we arrived at the airport, he got out of the van ahead of me and dropped the luggage from the back end of the shuttle and left it on the street. By the time I reach my luggage he was already driving to the next stop. I immediately discovered I got the lady's luggage instead of mine. I run for about 100 feet towards the crayzy shuttle when another shuttle driver offered his help to drive me there. From far I saw how terrified the young woman was as the driver was handing her the wrong luggage. Finally I reached the CLS Shuttle and exchanged luggage with the young lady. She and I were extremly happy we got our luggage back. Thanks God I wasn't running out of time to reach my flight back to Burbank Airport. While waiting to board my airplane, I called CLS and tried to reach anyone, but I got an answering machine. I left a message to the manager in charge reporting the incident and asking for a call back. As of today no one returned my call.

There's a sympathetic sign in the vehicle stating that gratuities are appreciated and that they account for 50% of their salary. What a joke. You'll only get a dollar out of me. Anyways, I recommend that you arrange an earlier pick up from the hotel to the airport, since there may be other stops on the way. The service is mediocre, but the prices are great.

Use the airport shuttles, it's cheaper. I think it was $6 or so per person to the hotel. Much cheaper than a cab. They have the prices posted outside so you can check it out when you arrive.",4,1
CLS Las Vegas,"Limos, Hotels & Travel, Transportation, Airport Shuttles","While waiting to get into Body English at the Hard Rock Casino, Cuba Gooding Jr popped out the doors and ran through the crowd into the casino. This being the most interesting thing happening at BE for the evening we decided to leave the ""line"" and head out to another club where we knew the bouncer. As we got into the taxi queue Cuba was hamming it up to the crowd, taking off his shirt. With his small entourage, he jumped inside a CLS Suburban limo. The taxi line was huge, so when we were offered a similar limo from CLS for $35 we accepted and jumped in. When we arrived at the Rio hotel the driver asked for $55! He said $35 was for a ""town car"", that we were in a ""limo."" What a f***ing scam. Damn those childproof automatic locks! At least I had some karmic justice later in the night. When we left the Rio another CLS dude was trying to solicit people to ride in a ""limo"" for $35 again. Too ploughed to care I started yelling - ""Don't do it! It really costs $55!"" He laughed and walked away from the crowd.",1,0

It's a scam. We bought 2 round trip tickets (San Diego / Las Vegas) via ReaderCity Deals. After reaching a recording every time we called over several days, we finally left a more stern message, someone returned our call and we were able to make a reservation. We received an email confirmation of the return trip and had to ask for the confirmation for the initial leg of the trip. So the time comes for our trip. We Uber down to Hotel Circle and wait at the address provided. The hotel there where you wait knows nothing about the bus by the way. We were at the top of a set of stairs so we could see the entire parking lot, road, etc. and we were there 15 minutes before the 15 minute window for pickup. Long story short - they NEVER SHOWED. We left countless voice mails on their ""office"" machine as well as the supposed 24 hour emergency dispatch number. Get this. It's 2 weeks later and we have yet to have any communication from them!! The trip was obviously ruined and we were in total disbelief that someone could do this and still sleep at night. If you have a voucher, don't even bother trying to use it.

Ugh strike 2! I called back several times again, finally receiving the same lady. Stating I just called and the line was disconnected(being nice but I know she hung up on me), she said I am the only one here with multiple individuals calling. Hmmm I see.

Did she offer to reschedule us?....NOPE just you can contact groupon for your refund. At that point, I was no longer interested in correcting her by saying it was through ReaderCity.

We had to take Lyft to the shuttle because they did not have secured parking at the pick-up location (a Carl's Jr. Parking lot). To top it off: The shuttle ended up dropping us off at the Las Vegas Transit Center, which is 3 MILES from the strip so we had to spend $18 to take Lyft to our hotel. We were supposed to be dropped off at Excalibur. On the way back, the same thing happened. We received this text (see photo). We live nowhere near either location and I explained to the rep that we were not going to pay to take a taxi to the Transit Center, so she booked us for one which she said was ""closer"".

It's a reasonable place to dine, because you have to drive at least 3 miles in any direction to find someplace else to eat (according to Yelp). They do give you a coupon at check-in for $2.50 off a non-happy-hour beer or a cocktail.

Clarion Inn Hudson - Akron North,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I should have known when the Waze app tried to make me do a U-turn away from the hotel on arrival, it was not going to be a stellar property. I'm not sure if they are undergoing renovations or what, but all of the hallways either dead-end, or you have to go outside to get to the next hallway...and there are weird handmade signs hanging everywhere for directions. When you check in, the front desk offers you a map of the hotel. TAKE IT! You'll never find your room, otherwise. And when I finally arrived at my room, there was a padlocked doorway separating my half of the hallway from the other half. I was afraid to think about who (or what) was staying in those rooms!! And the fitness center left something to be desired....the equipment was ancient. On the plus side....the king size bed was huge, and the room was pretty clean (though the coffee maker in the bathroom is kind of gross). And supposedly they offer free Wi-Fi, though the signal was so weak in my room, I couldn't access it. The bartender Kate was probably the highlight of my whole stay! She was awesome!!",2,0
Clarion Inn Hudson - Akron North,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","We were not fans of this hotel. The bed was clean which is an absolute must for me. The floor felt damp and sort of sticky, leading me to wear sandals at all times in the room, much like you would in a gym locker room! Gross. It was quite far from the town of Hudson which is quaint and nice. This hotel is in the middle of nowhere; not even a convenience store nearby for water and provisions. We went to the bar in the hotel which is seemingly (and I think unwisely) where they put a lot of the hotel budget. The regulars were a bit sketchy and very friendly with the bartender who hardly paid attention to us. Later when we tried to get room service the same bartender said on the phone 'Nooooo, I'm the only person at the bar and I can't leave.' I told her it said in the info book that room service was available until 10 to which she responded that we could order and come pick it up ourselves. Really? No thanks. We just went to bed and beat feet the next morning. I would not recommend this hotel based on it's condition and remoteness from town.",1,0

I got a call from the front desk after I had been there a few hours to ask if I needed anything. The hot breakfast bar was actually hot with good options. and instead of having breakfast in a stark breakfast room, it was in the restaurant, with table linens and servers ready to bring coffee or other drinks. If you are wiling to drive a few miles, the downtown area of Hudson has some good spots to eat and shop. There was an outdoor concert in the park when i was there. My only complaint is that the AC unit in the room was kind of loud. I would not hesitate to stay here again..",4,1

They did change the lock on my door one day during my stay where I went all the way up to the 8th floor, then had to come down to the front desk to ask for the new key. I told them I was surprised they did this without any notification. This must have been scheduled and should have been communicated at check in the day before. The next day they put fliers under the doors of the rooms they planned to change locks on, some of my coworkers staying here got the notice.

Cleveland Marriott East,"Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","Let me start by saying that I have been planning my family reunions at various hotels across the country for 12 years. I decided to try a new venue in Cleveland, the Marriott East. It was the worst decision ever. Things were going well in the planning phase until my original sales manager quit to go to a new hotel. The news sales manager was a nightmare. From the beginning, her customer service skills were horrible and she was very rude. Each time I would call her, she would act as though I was bothering her or as if our family reunion didn't matter. She was very stand offish from the beginning. It only went further downhill. On the weekend of our reunion, the food we ordered for the hospitality suite sat out uncovered for over 4 hours and had fruit flies flying over it. We were over charged (quoted one price and charged another) almost $400 for a small fruit and cheese platter that had fruit flies flying over it that had only grapes, Swiss cheese, and some crackers on it and a veggie tray that had mostly radishes on it. The hotel was busy that weekend because they had several events taking place and it showed! My room wasn't cleaned for 2 days and several of my other family members complained of the same thing. In addition, dirty towels were delivered to me. I had to call down to the desk several times to have my room cleaned, hotel toiletries, and for clean towels. When I brought all of these issues up, I was basically blown off. The sales and catering manager offered to give me some extra points. After that experience, even though I am and have been a rewards member for many years, who would want to stay in a Marriott again. She then offered to refund me my money for the food left out on Friday and then reneged on her promise, thus putting an even worse taste in my mouth about the whole experience. Bottom Line: the customer service at this hotel is horrible. Do not plan or host an event here. Take your money down the street to the Hilton or the Embassy Suites where their staff is friendly and courteous and will appreciate your business and treat you with respect and not just take your money and treat you like CRAP like the Marriott did us!",1,0

Room and hallway smelt like something was burning. Maid came and sprayed cleanser on floor to cover up smell, as we sat in room. Manager is ring leader of rude and unprofessional staff.

Cleveland Marriott East,"Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","Above and beyond the most disgusting hotel I have stayed in. First, I started out in a room that had a horrible smell and the lady up front was incredibly helpful and quickly changed up my rooms. Next room; smell is slightly better but at this point it's 1:30 in the morning and I will settle for anything. At which point I noticed some sort of food stain on one of the beds...it was marinara looking. Then I noticed a sea of hair that was not my own. And I was just appalled. I called down to the front desk again; apologizing because I hate being ""that"" person and the woman was super apologetic and assured me that she would have the supervisor of house keeping come make sure the room was fully cleaned. So, I left this morning...skeptical but hopeful only to come back to a room that had BARELY BEEN TOUCHED! The iron and board were still out (maybe they don't put these up anymore so I'm not really super peeved about that) but the food stains remained which meant all the hair. And don't even get me started with the bathroom. That was the worst. Hair everywhere; I am 99.9% sure they didn't even turn on the shower to rinse it down. So I call downstairs and I am told the manager and housekeeping will be right up. 15 minutes later; no one. At which point I call the travel agency and move. They charged me for the night and, believe me, they are going to get a fight on that. I took pictures and everything is documented. I will never stay at this hotel again. If you have to check for bed bugs; just leave. That is my new rule. I genuinely felt the place was so unclean that I ACTUALLY checked for bed bugs. (To be clear...there were none) So I decide game over. Get checked out and go downstairs and the manager is on the phone. I asked to check out and said they probably already printed something (she was very nice and probably unaware of what was going on) and the manager stays on the phone and hastily hands her my paper and doesn't even look me in the eye! I mean, I just can't even imagine being a manager in hospitality and being unable to talk to someone because they are upset. Had he taken the time to talk to me despite already being checked out; I can assure I would not have reviewed this hotel as poorly. As someone who travels three weeks out of the month I am extremely disappointed. I had switched from hiltons to Marriotts at the suggestion of a friend. Looks like I may be going back.",1,0

(Although there was a stain on the cushion. Probably time to replace it) The bed was incredibly comfortable. The bathroom was large. As a girl- I think they need better lighting. It is hard putting makeup on and knowing what it would look like in normal light. Also should have a fan in the bathroom. There was a refrigerator in the room and coffee. The bar/restaurant is nice if you don't feel like going out. Food is good- and decent selection. You're about 25 minutes from downtown Cleveland if you stay here. I would come again.",4,1
Cleveland Marriott East,"Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","This Marriott has a problem at the front desk. This is the most upsetting experience I have ever had while checking into a hotel. To put that in perspective, I stay at hotels at least a couple of times per month. I stay at Marriott hotels whenever I can because in the past I have always been able to count on consistent and excellent experiences. However, the person at the front desk when checking in here is not consistent with the Marriott brand. She was so rude and confrontational I will be sure to never stay at this location again. I reserved a room for two nights (the 10th and 11th) knowing that we most likely won't be checking in until the middle of the night the first night or very early morning the next day (11th). I phoned twice so that they were aware we would be checking in very late. Both times I was told it wasn't an issue and I confirmed that my account was noted. When I arrived and checked in at about 6am, the person at the front desk told me in a very nasty tone, ""it's a good thing my system hasn't switched over yet or else you would've had a problem"". Really? I don't need to know about your system. I prepaid for my room and was told it wouldn't be a problem twice AND the system has not ""switched over yet"" (whatever that means) so why even begin to address me that way?

The front desk lady that checked us in at midnight was pleasant despite the time, and even gave us tips on the hotel!

My room was clean on arrival. I literally have no complaints about my two-night stay here and I am a very picky and high-maintenance girl. The nice thing about the Marriott is also that there are many restaurants around it to choose from or walk to. The best is Giovanni's! Only two minutes away. It was not recommended me via the Marriott website of what is around- I found it off of yelp. If you stay at this Marriott do yourself a favor and go.

The public areas are very nice with plenty of seating areas in the lobby, and a huge water fountain in the center. I found the white noise near the fountain comforting, other reviewers here found it annoying. I did the Android mobile app check in process which was pretty quick but could have been further optimized. (Random computer work and writing of the room keys still needed done) It was very quick and in glad some companies are moving towards this. Next, the room was pretty nice. Comfortable large bed, couch, table, desk/chair with easily accessible outlets. Bathroom was fine. Everything was clean. It's not the nicest place I've stayed but it was up to standard given the room rate. I was lucky that Internet was included in my rate but for others is $10/24 hours. I hate nickel and diming. I had three problems that prevent me from giving five stars however: one, my room key simply stopped working. I had to call the front desk from the elevator lobby. At least they had a working phone there. I'd be mad if I would have had to walk back. They fixed the problem but I have a feeling this happens regularly. The second problem was that the site that allows Internet access refused my name and room number. A trip to the front desk fixed this, but I'd rather just be working than troubleshooting. Lastly, the included Internet rate ended up being billed to my room anyways, which required stopping at the front desk again.

Cleveland Marriott East,"Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","No free intenet at a hotel of this caliber??? Now I know why I choose Hilton... I typically stay at Hilton Hotels when travelling for work as I like taking advantage of my Honors rewards. When I learned that a recent meeting I would be attending would be taking place at a Marriott I was a bit disappointed as I have been Hilton-spoiled. I decided to check in early and called to ask about their policy on early check in. I was told that even though it was still a bit early in the morning that I could still check and I was pleasantly surprised I didn't get any pushback on this. When I arrived a short time later I approached the check in desk and explained I was checking in early for my reservation for that night. The front desk clerk had either pulled an all nighter or just wasn't very bright as she kept asking me how my stay was and referring to my check out. I had to interrupt a few times and re-explain that I was checking in. When she finally realized she processed my form of payment and got me my keys, etc. I had made sure when placing my reservation they had my Marriott Rewards # on file as well. Even though I don't stay at Marriott properties often, I wanted to ensure I credited my account for future purposes. After she finished my check in, I proceeded to ask her where the meeting rooms for this hotel were as it was my first time here and I wasn't familiar with the property. I don't think she understood again what I was asking as she walked around to the front of the check in desk to point out where the elevators to the rooms were. Again, I had to clarify I was asking about the meeting/conference rooms, not my actual room. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the room and furnishings. As I tried to log in and work off my laptop, much to my dismay, I found out that there is only free wi-fi if you are a Gold Marriott Rewards member or above. I was shocked as Hilton properties don't put this stipulation on any of its guests, regardless of their Honors level. As it was a work visit I didn't give it much thought as it would be expensed, but had I been staying here for personal reasons, I would have been livid at having to pay $9.95 plus taxes/fees per day for Internet. Not that I don't have $10 to spare, but for the sheer principle. This wasn't a cheap hotel. The meeting facilities were spacious and accomodating. My company had managed to reserve every room for the various meetings and breakout sessions that were occurring. The quality of the food prepared by their banquet facilities was also pretty good for a mass production deal. Another issue I experienced was that two weeks after my stay, I noticed I had not been credited for my stay through the Marriott Rewards program. Odd I thought as they had the number upon reservation and check in. I had to submit my receipt to them again in order to have it credited to my account. My overall rating for this property was based mainly on the lack of customer service. I guess I am spoiled by how much Hilton values their guests, which really shouldn't be a feat given that you are a paying guest.",2,0

There are filled trash cans in the lobby, noticeable dirt on the floors, handprints all over the elevator, etc. the stairway resembles something you'd find in a parking garage. There's trash in the corners and it's filthy. Use the elevator every time if you stay here. My room on the other hand seems clean. It appears to have been recently renovated. The bed is comfortable. Unfortunately there is a very strong chemical smell that kept me awake all night, two nights in a row. I wouldn't stay here again. I'm checking out early just to get away from the smell.",2,0
Comfort Hotel Downtown,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","NB: This is a very long review. I was very dissatisfied with our experiences here - unpleasant/uncaring hotel management, creaky floors, uneven carpets, door needed to be slammed to be closed properly, complimentary breakfast as borderline inedible (imagine the most average breakfast but a bit worse), all for a wonderful $229/night. I have not stayed in a worse hotel for this price point. My mom and I checked in at this Comfort Inn and we regretted it almost immediately. Right off the bat as we enter the hotel, I make eye contact with some guy pissing into this fenced-off construction area of the hotel. The receptionist we dealt with seemed like he really didn't want to be there and seemed rather ticked off that my dad had booked the hotel under his name instead of ours, saying ""he shouldn't have done that"" instead of trying to accommodate our situation pleasantly or perhaps explaining our mistake (nicely). We walk into our hotel room - but not before shoving the door closed because it doesn't close properly. Then we notice the A/C is on full blast and the room is freezing cold. The A/C control didn't work so all I could do was unplug the A/C. I also noticed the smoke detector was emitting this incessant beeping noise (but to be fair this stopped after an hour or so, there were much more pressing disappointments at this time). The water for the shower/bath works...but the opposite way it should - turning it to hot makes it freezing cold, and vice versa (had to call the front desk to figure this one out). The next day, we go to eat breakfast and jesus christ that was the most bearable-but-borderline-inedible breakfast I've had in quite a while. Soggy scrambled eggs, okay breakfast sausage, edible but worse is how the waffle maker run out of waffle batter and the employee working there notices that they've run out, mumbles something awkwardly in trying to suggest I use the blueberry waffle batter instead. We want to rent a car and then go to the front desk and for chrissake it's the same unpleasant guy from yesterday. We ask where we can rent a car and he tells us there's only one place in the area and to walk in some direction and take a left at some light (didn't mention any intersection). At this time, I thought this was a bit odd and googled car rentals myself - and lo and behold, there are 3-4 car rental places within walking distance from us (when he had clearly stated that there are no places nearby except for this one...discount car rentals). This is either poor/ignorant customer service or the hotel is running some deal with discount car rentals. I had not had one pleasant encounter with anybody at this hotel (except for the cleaning service, who were nice). I will tell every single person I know who lives around this area to never book this hotel. There are so many better options.",1,0
Comfort Hotel Downtown,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","They are the worst, I made my reservation over a month ago they told me I would have 2 queen beds bc I have 3 people in the room but when I got here it only had a queen and they wanted me to pay more to up grade when I did not get what I asked for in the first place!",1,0
Comfort Hotel Downtown,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","I know people say this all the time, but I seriously have never written a review before. That being said, I do not know what staying at this hotel is like. Somehow the dates I tried to book got mixed up and did not find out until the day I showed up to the hotel without a room. All of Toronto was booked solid, including this hotel. The front desk informed me that any cancelation of my reservation had to be done via the corporate website. Upon contacting the corporate office, I was informed that the hotel itself had to do the cancelation. I then received a condescending and rude email from the manager of this particular hotel that informed me in not so many words that my mistake was my fault and he was keeping my money, but would be willing to cancel my reservation so he could rebook the room if I was so inclined. I will never stay at this hotel. I would recommend you find an alternative place to rest your head because if something goes wrong they will not help you.",1,0
Comfort Hotel Downtown,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","I was not sure what to expect from a hotel of this type in a major metropolitan area - sometimes the rooms are very small, and phrases like ""limited parking"" ""first come first served"" are also a bit daunting. I was pleasantly surprised - and relieved - by the nice size of the room, though the bathroom was a little smaller, and the double beds also seemed a bit small. ""Temperature control"" is an old-style in-the-wall air conditioner. But there were plenty of outlets and USB port around the room, and the beds were comfortable. Parking is indeed limited, something like 16 spots downstairs. The good news is that if you can get one (which I did), it's yours for the rest of your stay, i.e., in-and-out privileges. When you go out, they'll put something in that spot to show its reserved. But it can be difficult squeezing into these spots with anything larger than a compact car. The breakfast area is actually on the first floor and not on the ground floor. It's a very large space, and I'd give the ladies who work here 5 stars apiece for the amount of work they do to keep things stocked. The waffle maker does not have a timer on it; you have to guess when your waffle is done. Otherwise, it's pretty standard Comfort Inn breakfast. This was also the first hotel at which I've stayed in a long time where they could not make change for me at the front desk (insufficient paper money). But for all these nits, I did enjoy my stay here, it was comfortable, and I would definitely consider staying here again if I were in the area.",3,0

Comfort Hotel Downtown,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","I got a room here last minute when I was downtown. I booked it off of Booking.com and got a decent deal for the room. Though there were a few issues that I have to address: I had to park my car across from the hotel in a parking lot that was $20.00 since there was construction for the hotels parking lot so I couldn't park there. The person at the parking lot had said that it would be $20.00 now to park here as well as $10.00 tomorrow after 11:00AM. I prefer late check outs and this was just inconvenient. To top it all off my room had no latch on it to safely lock the door. I suppose this is why there was a deal? I am just making assumptions. Also don't be walking around in the middle of the night. Why would I want to bring someone that I love to a place that isn't secure? The person at guest services wasn't rude, he was quite polite actually. There was coffee in the morning.",2,0

Comfort Inn doesn't offer parking and the underground Green P parking is under construction these days so not an option. Our room was nice and spacious, clean, no complaints there but check out the door ""lock"" I think you guys forgot something integral for such a ""dangerous"" (at night) area and thus rounds off my 2 star rating.

Every day we had to call down for more toilet paper because they wouldn't refill it and they weren't leaving enough towels. The toilet was semi functional, when it wasn't constantly running. One remote control for two TVs.

Comfort Hotel Downtown,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","Stayed here for a business trip. It's an older building that has been remodeled. The rate was reasonable for the services provided, but the building has a serious problem with people smoking in it. The ventilation is very poor, and so people who violate the No Smoking policy cause issues for non-smokers in other rooms. On multiple occasions I had a smoke smell overpower my room, but had no idea where it was coming from. It cleared from the main room within a few minutes, but lingered in the bathroom the rest of the night. The staff informed me strongly on sign-in that there was a no smoking policy, and so it seems they're aware of the problem but powerless to do anything to fix it. I eventually complained about it, and they moved me to another room. This seemed fine, until the weekend. At that point, several people went out drinking, and returned at 3:30 in the morning.

And WAY too crowded to find a seat or any kind of comfortable place to stand where you don't feel like you're standing in the way. AA And I think I discovered at least PART of the reason why it is so unnecessarily busy: American Airlines had overbooked (yet again) and so they were looking for volunteers - not that this is a direct issue with the airport, but when you have LOTS of overbooked flights - and multiply all those passengers by each flight - that certainly increases the passenger density in the surrounding concourses. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/concourse-b-charlotte-douglas-international-airport-charlotte?select=4fj1-5xuYwJeCVmJy1MkHQ&userid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w THE LOWDOWN One of the interesting paradoxes where I believe your luggage is treated better than you are (and not that that is necessarily a BAD thing if you value your luggage getting to your destination).

Courtyard by Marriott Charlotte Concord,"Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services",After planning a month ahead of time we show up to have none of the reservation requests we had made met. They gave away our adjoining room and put us on different floors - we were traveling with young children and multiple families and had been assured these needs would be met. We needed extra blankets and there were none. Some of the rooms were not thoroughly cleaned and one had zero toilet paper in the bathroom when we checked in. Rooms weren't even ready until after 4:30! Also there's no breakfast. I would not recommend this hotel as there are plenty of other nicer hotels in this area. We went with cheapest which matches the service we received!,1,0

Courtyard by Marriott Pittsburgh Downtown,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels","I stayed at the Courtyard Downtown for three nights- I enjoyed my stay and would absolutely stay here again. However, I found some of the service to be uncharacteristic of a Marriott (see below). Pros - Great location, close to the Megabus drop-off, convention center, and bars/restaurants. - I had a large corner room with high ceilings and of natural light looking out onto Penn Ave. Very comfortable beds/chairs. - Fridge with a legit freezer (and ice tray!) - I received 500 Marriott points for waiving housekeeping. - I ate breakfast downstairs (a la cart) 2 out of my 3 mornings and the food was good. I also loved that they offered different blends of Starbucks coffee, including blonde/Veranda (my favorite). Cons - I specifically requested a room with a microwave before I arrived, but my room did not have one. - None of the rooms have safety deposit boxes, which I found to be odd. They do have them available for use at the front desk, but not all of the staff seem to know what to do with them (insert the key and open the box?). - The floors in the rooms are very creaky, and also have the black stains that other reviews have mentioned. Sounds from other rooms, including bathrooms travel very easily through the air vents. I was also able to hear sounds from the hallway. My biggest complaint however has to do with the inconsistent customer service that I personally received. First and foremost, many front desk staff members appeared to be college/grad-school aged (young to mid 20's). Normally this wouldn't phase me, but I felt some staff were not as professional towards me or others close in age. I also found two female staff members at the front desk to be particularly unfriendly. For instance, when I attempted to retrieve my belongings from my safety deposit box, one female attendant behind the counter completely ignored me and wouldn't even look up- I could see her computer screen and she wasn't doing anything, and she would also check her phone. The valet/bellhop attendant standing next to her finally asked what I needed, and he then looked at her to respond, but still refused to acknowledge me, and instead told the him to go get someone because she ""didn't know what I was asking"" or ""how to do it"". The attendant who eventually came out was helpful and I interacted with her several times throughout my stay. She seemed annoyed to help me, but would then be very friendly to the next person after me. Other staff members were very friendly and helpful, though.",4,1
Courtyard by Marriott Pittsburgh Downtown,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels","A mediocre hotel disguised as higher end. With the ""Marriott"" title you expect to see great rooms with all the standard hotel amenities at the least, but that is not true for the Courtyard Marriott Pittsburgh. There aren't microwaves or refrigerators in the rooms (maybe in some, but not in our 2 queen room), the latches on the wardrobe are broken, the drawers have a broken track, the shower spurts in all different directions, and the room is honesty pretty small. To top it all off, I ended up paying $646.80 for such a mediocre room because their crazy ""taxes"" and freaking $25 a night parking charge. This hotel is very convenient to the convention center, as it's just a quick block away, but if you need to stay here for that reason- seriously consider parking elsewhere, and don't forget to bring a cooler for your drinks. If it were a much much less expensive hotel I'd have nearly no complaints, but this is WAY too high of a price to pay for such mediocrity.",3,0

It was right downtown so it was easily accessible to the Strip Disctrict, PNC Park, etc. If you couldn't walk there.. you could definitely take a cheap cab/Uber ride around.

Courtyard by Marriott Pittsburgh Downtown,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels",I give this rating based on other Courtyard hotels. It is a fine hotel however I did not encounter friendly employees like others have reviewed. My first experience was watching the front desk attendant toss a cigarette butt that she finished into the street which is one of my pet peeves. I arrived late - a little after midnight - but I used the mobile check in which I've had great experience with in the past - your keys are ready as soon as you arrive. I was within 30 minutes of my planned arrival but I guess they gave my room away since they did not have the 2 beds I had reserved. Additionally she took a few minutes finding me a room. I don't think Marriott informed this location how the mobile checkin is supposed to work. I like that Marriott is smoke free - however they allow it in the actual courtyard here (they have a true courtyard at this location - that's great!!) - which I'm surprised - but it was not anyone actively smoking that bothered me - it was the old cigarette butts in the ashtrays and I could not avoid the awful cigarette smell anywhere in the courtyard. On the plus side: my room was large with a high ceiling and you cannot beat the location.,2,0

Courtyard by Marriott Pittsburgh Downtown,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels","I attend an annual convention at the David Lawrence Convention Center, and have many choices for downtown Pittsburgh hotels - year after year, I have found none I like better than this Courtyard Marriott. When I checked in this year, I was having a full-blown airline crisis, a colleague who was to help me set up my convention booth had been bumped from a flight and it was taking forever to find a workaround using different city pairs for travel that same day. I was able to leave my vehicle PARKED right in front of the hotel for nearly 2 hours while I sorted it out. The valet staff and front desk staff as well were VERY helpful in allowing me the time I needed to sort out my travel disaster, extending every courtesy in the process. In particular, Jean Stefan was the most helpful. My booking agent made a transcription error shortening my stay - and that mistake was quickly corrected by Jean. From the super high ceilings in the room, along with the much larger than usual sq/ft of both the room and bathroom, I will not choose to stay at any other downtown Pittsburgh hotel. The ""courtyard"" is lovely, well decorated, and amazingly comfortable on summer evenings. The proximity to the convention facilities next door are MORE convenient than the Westin, which is directly attached to DLCC - but actually a much longer walk (to get to DLCC Hall B anyway). My only suggestion to improve the guest experience: leave the courtyard open until midnight (or even better, never closed) instead of 10:30pm - and simply warn loud guests that the courtyard will be closed early if they can not keep it quiet. Kudos to the staff, for making my third stay the best one yet.",5,1

I had a bad impression of this hotel before I even entered. I made a two-night reservation for a business trip, but I was stranded in an airport overnight because of cancelled flights. I called the hotel to explain my situation and asked to change my reservation, but the receptionist was not having it. She was completely unsympathetic to my plight and insisted me to pay for the night that I'm not staying. Eventually, I had to get my project manager to resolve this issue. Both the room and the lobby were not spacious, although that's understandable given that the hotel was in downtown. What's not understandable was the creaking floor throughout the hotel floor, which amplified no matter how light my steps were. Good thing that I was not living below night owls, but that would not matter because the AC unit was too loud to get a good sleep anyway. Why would a Marriott hotel have an AC unit that's louder than my grandma's AC unit from the 1980s is completely beyond me. Seriously reconsider if you decide to live here. Aside from sub-par room and service that are unusually low by the Marriott standard, note that the only available parking nearby will escalate the unjust price that you have to pay to stay in this hotel.",2,0

Crawford Auto-Aviation Museum,"Museums, Hotels & Travel, Tours, Landmarks & Historical Buildings, Arts & Entertainment, Public Services & Government","What a fantastic car museum! The collection of ""veteran"" brass-era cars is one of the best I have seen. I could have been happy enough just looking at the ground-level displays, but then I discovered that there is a huge basement area that is packed full of a wide variety of classic cars! One huge cool factor is the number of cars they have that were built in Ohio. OH isn't well-represented in the auto industry anymore, but the vehicles here show that Ohio has been a part of automotive history since the early days of the automobile. Other than that, they've got a good variety of cars across brands, countries, and eras - some really unique pieces here! Some highlights for me were the electric Bakers, a 1913 Alco, a couple Chrysler concept cars, and four stainless-steel-bodied cars (only one of which was a DeLorean!). Of course, they've got examples of all the more popular pieces of automotive history, like a Mercedes 300SL, Ferrari 365 California, Ford Model T's, Packards, Chryslers, Oldsmobiles, etc. even a GM EV1! It seems a little weird to me that they have a big fancy carousel, and the price of admission includes two tokens for rides. Uhh, thanks?? I didn't want them, and I felt weird approaching a couple kids in the museum and offering them my tokens -- but I would've felt weirder if I was riding around on the carousel myself. They could do away with that and I wouldn't mind. There's also a few highlights of aviation history here ... not much, almost an afterthought or a side-project.

Cruise America Motorhome Rental & Sales,"RV Rental, Hotels & Travel, RV Repair, Automotive","Whoever heard of a company with a customer relations department you can't speak with and can only email. Then once you do that you need to wait 10 to 30 days for a reply. My issue is with the corporate office and not the local agent in Stoughton, MA. I rented a large class C Motorhome the week of July 6, 2013 and am currently on vacation. I was planning to take the RV and stay with family at at cottage on cape cod. So on May 15th I spoke via chat with a representative of Cruise America to ask if we needed any special connection to allow an electric hook up at a residential home. The representative (Arron) replied we just need an adapter and should verify with the local agent at time of pick up that it was indeed onboard. We verified it was there and headed for our vacation week on Cape Cod. Upon arrival we followed the instruction and attempted to connect to the house. After about a minute the fuse in the house would blow. So then we tried a neighbors house and same thing happened. We then contacted Cruise America assistance left a message and waited for a call back. When then called back (about an hour later) the technical assistance person informed us that 75% of the time the electrical connections do not work at residential homes. Our only choice then was to use the generator at a cost of $3.50 plus it uses fuel at about a gallon per hour. Now this week on Cape Cod is one of the hottest on record with temps in the 80's and 90's and humidity that makes it feel 90 to 100 degrees. I attempted to talk with a supervisor however the technical support person advised there was nothing they could do for me except to advise to write an email to customer relations explaining the situation. Again, a 10 to 30 day wait to get a response well after I am due to return my vehicle and be charged for the generator usage by the local agent who was not part of the problem. I was told by corporate to contact the local rep who advised I should contact corporate as they were the ones who had advised it would be OK. I then called the reservations line on the advice of the local rep and told to ask for a supervisor. I explained the situation to the first person I got and was advised I could speak to a supervisor but the only way to deal with this was to wait for a reply to my email sent to customer relations. He then transferred me to a voice mail of or Tina with International where I left my message with the problem along with my phone number and again I'm still waiting for a call back which will probably not happen! Looks like my only recourse will be to dispute the charges to get someones attention at the corporate office.",1,0
Cruise America Motorhome Rental & Sales,"RV Rental, Hotels & Travel, RV Repair, Automotive","Cruise America completely ruined our vacation. We picked up the dirty, stained, broke down RV in Fillmore, CA.. The RV was in very bad condition! ( we had drove 8 hours from home and had already paid for it so we decided to make the best of it and take it) The seats had hole's and stains, the cupboards were broken, water was leaking. They sent out 7 lady's in an RV that was dangerous. The bald front tire nearly fell off and they had to send someone out to replace it and that took two days. Then they wanted us to take it to the service center and wait for god knows how long for them to fix it or make a 3 hour trip to Compton, CA to exchange it. We opted to end our vacation and return the broke down palace back from whence it came because that was only 30 miles away and we did not feel safe traveling that distance in it! NOTHING was working, we had no power, no water, no sewer, and the indicator panel was broke, all the propane leaked out while we slept, thank God we had the windows open! My advice is to reserve a nice Hotel room! It will be cheaper and safer for you and your family! Thanks Cruise America for running our vacation and trying to kill us! I can not believe you would send people out in such a death trap....shame on you!!",1,0

The front desk person promised to have a cooler with ice waiting in our room and for us to get the first one that will be free.

The pool seemed okay however had tons of kids in it so we steered clear of that. Also the wifi was only working in the lobby which was a huge inconvenience since we are from the states and rely on wifi to use our phones. The room itself was okay, nothing too impressive although there was no mini safe for your belongings. The breakfast buffet was way overpriced for the basic pancake, toast and egg display. The only great thing I would say was the bartender and beer selection!",2,0

The tomatoes were not very good, but the omelette station was commendable! I would not pay for this breakfast buffet though!! Definitely not worth it. I think if you have kids this hotel is really great. They have this huge indoor pool with slides that the kids seemed to love!

Delta Hotels by Marriott Toronto East,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Overall I had no major problems with this hotel. The lobby area is interesting, with the indoor pool and two-story water slide right in the center. There's a bar and a restaurant just inside the lobby, and an expensive Japanese restaurant on the 14th floor. The wifi was free and worked pretty consistently, with a couple of drops depending on where I was. The food at the main restaurant in the lobby, called ""Whitesides"", was about average (review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/whitesides-terrace-grille-toronto#hrid:CzblVcLPRS-rNZlomW2Kyg ). I went up to the 14th floor to check out the Japanese restaurant (promoted in the lobby as ""The Cities (sic) Best Japanese Restaurant"") but the menu posted by the entrance included only two selections, each of which was $55. So I turned around and went elsewhere, not looking at the giant promotional sign again as I passed by it the second time for fear I'd feel compelled to correct the grammar with a Sharpie and get kicked out of the hotel. If it hadn't been for the customer's suggestion (they got a corporate rate here), I wouldn't have considered this an ideal hotel for business travelers. Probably due to the pool (which I admit, is awesome) the vast majority here were families with small, squealing/screaming children. I'm not particularly sensitive to that, so it didn't bother me too much, but if you really need your quiet then it's something to take into consideration. The first two floors around the lobby area reek intensely of chlorine because of the pool, so that's another thing to consider when booking a room. Oh, also - no refrigerators in the rooms, although I believe you can request one at the front desk. I'm not sure if there's a nightly charge or not.",3,0

Goes to 10 feet deep, and long enough to do laps while also having an area for kids to play in. - Gym - decent - towels, water, tv. Free weights up to 50lbs. Plenty of machines. - Wifi connects quickly. Recently changed their Wifi policy. They tiered it up to 3 different levels varying on speed. 1st tier level is complimentary (512mbps down) I was able to stream netflix just fine. You put in your name and room number (with a 0 in front of it for free wifi) - Breakfast is amazing. One of the freshest and wide variety of breakfast food available - Large TVs in the rooms Yes, it is true that it has the ""old but renovated feel"" to the structure and rooms. Yes, parking does cost money but for me, my parking was free or included in my nightly rate. If the nightly rates were $10 - 15 bucks more and parking was free, you would not be complaining about having to pay for parking. It's all just how you look at it. Yes, there is a Japanese restaurant on the top floor. However, it's highly overpriced and not worth it. Avg price per person - expect to spend 50+ a person.

Call the number listed on your confirmation info and the staff will direct you to the correct Zone to wait for the shuttle (some other ladies did not read their info sheet properly and went to the other airport-affiliated off-site shuttle location, wasting 1.5 hours of their time). The car rental location is 10-15 minutes away from the airport. - Because I had called for a shuttle, the staff had all my paperwork and car ready and waiting when we arrived at the rental location. - You will need proof of insurance so bring your credit card benefits/disclosure booklet if you are waiving rental car insurance coverage (they need a printed document showing your credit card covers the rental - this can easily be downloaded online from any visa credit card site). We were in and out in less than 15 minutes. - We also got a free upgrade from a compact car to an SUV because they were out of compacts (some people may not like this but it was great for us because we were going camping in the mountains). - When we returned to drop off the car, the process was completed in less than 10 minutes and we were packed off on the shuttle back to the airport. - It is much cheaper to rent from them than an airport-based company because you don't have to pay the airport taxes (I think). - The staff were very helpful and friendly and even called me on day 2 to see if our rental was going well.",5,1

I complained to manager, a hotel staff member came in and told the kids not to jump in hot tub. She said nothing about food, overcrowding, lack of parents with children.

This worked in my favor as this place was amazing. They serve an afternoon meal with some vegan options ( salad, baked potatoes), as well as pasta, chili, and hot dogs. Three free drinks per adult. I watched two women feed and pass drinks to about 200 people without batting an eye. Same staff was back in the morning for the buffet. It was clean and cheap. Use the website for better prices than third party. With all the free food, cleanliness, and customer service, you'd be cheating yourself staying somewhere else.",5,1

There was a small salad bar, hot dogs, nachos, pasta, baked potatoes and popcorn. The bartender, Ibai ( I think) made a great Bloody Mary. Both Ian and Ibai, worked the dining room to make sure everything was clean and the guests were happy. I had an issue with the A/C unit and Ian came to my room and fixed it.

As with every Drury Inn I've been at, it was exceptional for a mid-priced hotel. They offer free alcoholic drinks and some nice appetizers in the early evening (if you're lucky enough to get there in time). Late evening is free popcorn and soda. The rooms are about what I expect for a mid-priced hotel. They have a nice, hot breakfast buffet, too. The evening/morning perks win me over.",5,1
Drury Inn & Suites Champaign,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","We stayed at the Drury last night after spending the weekend in Champaign. My boyfriend booked the room on Travelocity and paid $70 for a normally $200+ room. The room itself looked a little nicer than a typical hotel room, but was beginning to show a little bit of wear (some wallpaper discoloration by the ceiling, a little bit of peeling). The room did have a huge LG TV (channels were analog and digital), a microwave and mini fridge tucked into a mahogany-colored cabinet under the TV, a big armchair, a desk area, and big fluffy pillows on our king bed. There were also a lot of ""freebies"": (1) ""Dinner"" (hotdogs, popcorn, baked potatoes, celery and carrots... the menu varies slightly each day with 2-3 different items rotated into a standard menu) + 3 free drinks (including alcoholic) 5:30-7 (2) Wi-fi and computer access (3) Breakfast (coffee, overly mushy and bland scrambled eggs, sausage patties, cheese, ham cubes, waffles, and biscuits) (4) Long distance calls It was also within a very short walking distance of Lone Star Steakhouse, Culvers, and across the street from Applebees, Cheddar's, and a strip mall. IMO, the shower was the best: the water pressure was wonderful, the water was nice and hot, and I could actually move the shower head up to accommodate my 5'10"" height. Fabulous! The staff was also very nice without being fake. All of the areas were clean. I would definitely go to the Drury again.",4,1

How many times before us was this practice used? I questioned him on this and all I got was ""what difference does it make?""

Here's my explanation. Some room types where described as having 27"" televisions and pictures clearly show a flat tv. When I saw the room didn't have this I went back to let them know the mistake. This is when he went from passive to down right rude. After arguing with me for a few that it was not offered I showed him on the site that it clearly was, to which he replied ""it has a tv doesn't it. What's your problem?""

It's a family of people that manage (not own) the place that gave it more than 1 star and that's their only saving grace and it was dirt cheap. I think I paid 150 for the week. The decor is straight from the 50s and 60s with wood panelling. It smells weird. The mattresses have a noisy plastic cover under the sheet. The neighborhood is really REALLY sketchy. There are transients all over the place. It is right under the shadows of the Stratosphere hotel which isn't in the nicest part of town.. not to mention after the Sahara closed in 2011, the area is even more of a ghost town. No internet.

Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","UPDATE: After submitting a feedback form, I was contacted by management and issued a refund for the price discrepancy. I have raised my star rating based on their response. I appreciate that they reached out. *** The MindBody app used for appointments does not reflect current pricing. It shows a nonmember price of $99 for a 90-minute massage. I did not find this out until I was paying at the end of the service. In addition, I wasn't informed until the therapist was finishing up that I would not, in fact, be receiving a 90-minue massage, but an 80-minute massage. So I was paid more for a shorter service. No offer to honor the price, and no apology was made, though one of the women did say they'd have someone look into the app pricing because she ""didn't want this to keep happening."" The other woman at the front desk, who actually argued with me about the price, even after I showed her the app, then informed me the last to minutes was to let us get dressed, etc., which is totally absurd. Luckily she also told me this is standard practice at all Elements now, so I will be sure to avoid all locations. The massages themselves aren't bad, which is why I'm giving one extra star, though both therapists I had appointments with there are very talkative. Good if you have pain issues, but not so much for relaxation.",3,0

The lobby isn't bad and the staff are very nice and helpful. Once you enter the elevator, all bets are off. The carpets are dingy and smell, with stains literally all over the place. The wiring in the room for the lights on one wall near the sink was all jacked up and if you used the microwave it would flicker and go out, same would happen if you plugged anything else in nearby. The window shades aren't very effective at all. The lighting in the hallways in hardly lighting. And unlike every other Element we've stayed at, they charge a sneaky pet fee! $20 more than they say they'll charge in the fine print, in our case! Oh, and they use disposable plasticware in their breakfast area. This left a bad taste considering they're a green/eco-friendly establishment.

Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Here's another example of a great property that is poorly run. Upon arriving to check in, the front desk girl was in the back, eating, and didn't even notice me for what seemed like forever. I asked her about the suites and I could see her eyes, looking for an answer. As an SPG platinum, I'm supposed to get the suite upgrade but by the looks of her searching eyes, management has requested that they do not give these upgrades unless it fits under certain circumstances that obviously I didn't match even though I'm platinum and it's supposed to be automatic. She didn't even check to see if the suites were occupied. Was just...whatever. The property is modern and clean. The rooms are also modern in style with nice features like a full kitchen, a work desk, couch, and it's good sized. Unfortunately, too many other things make it easy to look past the good things of this property. I came here to study for an exam. All night long, either the next door or upstairs neighbors were very loud. I don't know if it was kids but it was until very late, like past midnight. When I come to a place like this for quiet, I kind of expect quiet. So, I switch on the television for background noise and the cable is out. I call the front desk and they send an engineer but at that point, I just wanted to leave and reset. I couldn't focus with multiple distractions. I'm not sure what he fixed because when I returned, the premium movie channel was still out. I called again and the front desk said it should be working...but, it wasn't. But, it should be working...but, it wasn't. Like, how many times do I have to ask? Over it. So, after waking up early from neighbors, house keeping has already banged on my door 3 times and tried to enter each time. I do not have a do not disturb sign. It is not here but wow, it's not even close to check out time and it's actually pretty early in the morning. I did get up to study but again, having a hard time focusing. I actually live in Vegas but just needed to get away for peace and quiet thinking that this relatively remote location from the hustle and bustle of the strip would be quiet. Nope. The free breakfast was basic continental breakfast. Silver dollar pancakes (pre made), sausage, scrambled eggs, oatmeal. Cereal and milk. Juice. One other thing I noticed is that other guests seem to be pretty rude here. I know that's obviously not directly controlled by the property but I'm wondering if they are like that because they are also unhappy with their stay. Barging in while I'm at a breakfast station. Noisy like they are on the strip late at night. Ugh... This is my third or fourth time staying here. I don't recall these problems in the past but I haven't been here for about a year. I hope it's not always like this.",1,0
Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","A pretty clean, smoke-freeing(okay outside), cozy hotel on the edge of Las Vegas: an 8mile drive to The Strip and 45min to the Arizona Hot Springs.

The only issue I had was that the toilet clogged after a nice dump (not an aggressive one with huge hard shards). The hotel services include: 1) 24hr gym, somewhat small, - 3 treadmills, 3cycling machines, 1 bench for dumbbells, 5 machines that focus on hamstring, calves, chest, back and shoulders (no bench press or squats racks for the swoles) 2) breakfast 6:30-9:30am - standard hotel breakfast, you eat next to the lobby or in the lobby since they lack tables 3) pool - the rectangular one, not the weird looking ones, good for laps (no hot tub or sauna :c ).

They never called back. We did have a small bag of cigars sitting on the counter for the 5-6 days we were there in their defense, but again we're smoked outside and never in the room. Seems like a little gimmick to charge an extra $280 from my perspective. I tried for 2-3 weeks to get the manager on the line and just kept getting passed around from employees and the other managers.

Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","pros...want to be in las vegas, but not on the strip? want to bring your pooch with you on your vacation in vegas? want to go to a hotel that is completely smoke free? well this is the place for you. it is a good 20 minutes off the strip, but that's a good thing for me. this place was clean, pretty new and had very nice accommodations as well. my buddy henry never goes on vacation without his dog sam. and this place lets him keep sam safe and sound. sam is a rescue and would rather spend time with his new parents. anyways, the rooms are nice and clean, and the furnishings are modern and minimalist. our room was a nice studio type, as it had two small burners and all the kitchen equipment that you needed for a couple of days to a week if need be. and the hotel was close enough to some restaurants and a few coffee shops as well. and if you wanted to get around on bikes but didn't bring your own, there was a cycle shop where you could rent them. internet was everywhere, and it was free. parking was plentiful and the spaces were plenty wide for the rental van. and on the weekends you get a nice hot breakfast. the normal stuff was there: toast, bagels, spreads, cereal, juice, milk, eggs, sausages, sweet rolls, fruit, tea, coffee, and the like. weekday breakfasts are not as diverse but still they had breakfast burritos and all the cold stuff: cereal, toast, yogurt and the like. cons...like i said, it is about a 20 minute drive to the strip. but that's not bad, not much traffic out here. and pretty close to some groceries stores, but you better have a car. not much. if we go back to vegas this is the place where we are staying. and i can bring my dog chuchu too.",5,1
Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","What a great place to stay in Vegas! Element at Summerlin is a Westin hotel gem! The staff here are wonderful, great customer service and very helpful and friendly. Nothing beats a welcoming staff after a long day of driving or a long flight. They offered beverages upon check in and asked if we needed help carrying our luggage. From now on we have a great place to stay when we vacay in Vegas. They are pet friendly too, unlike most pet friendly hotels, they are very clean and if you weren't even aware that there are animals staying in the hotel, you honestly wouldn't know it or hear it. But The Element is specactularly clean and no animal odors for being a pet friendly hotel. I love it!!! This was our first stay at this hotel and the experience was amazing, the room we stayed in was a studio suite booked at $110 a night, (full kitchen, sofa, full size fridge, dishes, full size dishwasher and microwave). Like most A/Cs in Vegas hotels, they set them at 65 degrees but at this hotel you can set it all the way down to 60! Nothing like walking in a nice cool room especially in Vegas! The views from our room faced the 215 Beltway and the Summerlin Mountains. Gorgeous. The beds are soft and the interior design is very minimal and modern (simple is best). They have a safe in the closet if you wish to lock valuables away. The bathrooms were simple yet very modern and elegant. The shower heads had two different head setting, hand held and a huge raindrop shower head. Let's put it this way...I took 4 showers (we stayed one day!) It felt like being in a spa!!! Body soap and Shampoo/Conditioner is provided on a mounted pump so no need to bring your own shower essentials, plus it's all organic/natural! They give you an ample amount too!!! Wi-Fi is free throughout the hotel too. They serve buffet style breakfast that is served every morning for free! Looked pretty good but we didn't have a chance to try it. Bummer. Next time. They have cabanas and the pool is heated and is open until 11pm, we didn't have the chance to try it but it looked beautiful, next time we will check it out. This hotel is very modern and it being tucked away in Summerlin makes it a hidden jewel in the hot desert. Parking if free too, only negative thing is, if you run out of parking iin the front and on the sides, you have no option but to park in the back and walk your all the way around to the front to get in. Otherwise it's ample parking, we must of came during a convention. Glad we booked!!! Also, just down the street is a 24hr. gas station so if you needed some snacks or gas it's very convenient. Element at Summerlin is also a GREEN/Energy Efficient hotel. I would highly recommend this place to all my family and friends. :) 10555 Discovery Drive | Las Vegas, NV 89135 | (702) 589-2000 Until then, Happy Vacationing!!!",5,1
Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Great hotel with one major flaw... if the person in the floor above you is a stomper or wearing hard heels, good luck getting rest. The rooms are modern with partial hardwood floors, so the dampening between floors is compromised. Person staying above me was 'clacking' back and forth across the floor till 1:37AM. What can I say, stay as high up as you can I suppose. Otherwise, the rooms/hotel is very new, the mini kitchen is well worth the slight upgrade in price, the gym is clean and functional, and the breakfast is pretty well executed. A lot to like about this place. One other slight knock is that it is pretty close to the freeway. If you're a SUPER light sleeper, this might be a slight problem. The password free wi-fi is another huge bonus anywhere in the hotel.",4,1
Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","This is probably the coolest hotel I've every stayed at. My wife and I had an extended stay here while we moved from Wyoming to LV. So eco-friendly, clean, and courteous. Their breakfast every morning is delicious and varied, so it doesn't really get old. It's pet friendly, though I wish they had a designated pet area. There are full kitchens in the rooms, and the beds are very comfortable. It made the transition very easy and fun. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat for either a one-night or extended stay.",5,1
Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Stayed here one night with family. The positives are great free breakfast--- eggs, sausage, coffee, egg white sandwiches (yes they attempt to minimize your cholesterol), smoothies, pancakes, granola, juices, coffee, tea, fruit, etc... Second positive; hotel is very clean, modern, has kitchenette, and very computer/tech oriented rooms . KING bed plus sofa bed pull out has plenty of room for three people. The other configuration is two Queens plus sofa, but the sofa has no pull out bed. Third positive: front desk and housekeeping are very responsive..bringing me razors plus shaving cream and blankets quickly and plus a big bag of complimentary ice on your way out if you need it. Fourth positive: location is very close on and off freeway. Friday night time drive to the Las Vegas STRIP is only 23 minutes driving east on Flamingo Blvd. Fifth positive: They have a pool and work out room/ but warn you the pool is COLD even though the ambient weather is 95 degrees and HOT. Highly recommend staying here if you do not need to be close to the STRIP.",4,1
Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","First off I will say we went to Vegas to visit friends who live there, not to go to the strip so proximity to the strip was not an issue for us. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite which was awesome because we have two small kids. this allowed us to stay up and hang out in the living room after they went to sleep. If you've ever tried to put a kid to bed at 8pm in a regular hotel room you'll understand why that is awesome. Breakfast was way better than expected. not just cereal and coffee, they had eggs, sausage, pancakes and some other stuff. Pool was nice. small but nice. all the staff we encountered were extremely friendly. I'm giving it a 4 instead of 5 for some small reasons. I've stayed in hotels that are a little more luxurious and would reserve a 5 for them. fluffier towels, higher end bath soaps etc. But overall it's a nice place and I would stay there again for sure.",4,1
Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I can't believe this place was only $100 a night. I want to remodel a vacation condo after our room here. Hip, clean, simple. And the space was used with thought. A complete kitchen, couch, desk, two queen beds and big bathroom. You really can't beat the complementary breakfast. Strawberry smoothie, egg white and tomato english muffin, great coffee (for reals), grapefruit juice (the real stuff) and tons more! Not to mention the saltwater pool and the private cabanas. They even had a simple, clean crib for our little one. And they let us keep our Bernese Mountain Dog in our room! The front desk and the breakfast help were all incredibly accomodating and friendly. I wish we could take this hotel to all of our travel destinations. LOVE",5,1
Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","We will never stay at this particular Westin property again. Here's our terrible story: We reserved a room here mostly out of respect for the reviews we found on YELP. I double checked the YELP reviews by reading up in the AAA Guide. The AAA Guide as well as the Westin employee who booked our room reservation assured us this was a pet friendly property. So....I checked us out of the pet friendly (and more fun & affordable) Rio to try this property. Our room was decent, if spare. There was no bathtub but there was a rather worn shower. The laundry facility door doesn't latch which I wasn't too keen about while in there doing laundry at night, alone. They offer no way to make change for their laundry machines. We would have appreciated some other method than a lengthy trek back to the front desk for change. As I was busily loading our luggage the next morning, there was a very light sharp rap at our door. I wasn't sure I'd actually heard a knock so I walked toward the door to look out our keyhole viewer. Believe it or not, the employee at our door didn't bother to wait a moment for me to open it. She let herself in! Having worked in hospitality for many years, I was stunned by this intrusion. This Westin offered no ""do not disturb"" signs so I had left a post-it ""privacy please"" note on our door. She defended her uninvited entry saying, ""Well, you've gotta double lock the door if you don't want us to let ourselves in!"". Unbelievable. I guess she didn't like my offended attitude because a few minutes later, their hothead of a ""general manager"" appeared at our door. He accused my six year old & me of ""smoking in the room"". The only smoke in our room was the steam shooting from my ears at his attitude and his offensive posture. This man didn't know when to leave bad enough alone. I informed him we were in the process of loading our car and would gladly be giving him his hotel room back in a few minutes. I gently closed the door and turned back to my six year old child, our now frenzied Yorkie & the bags we were trying to pack. I suppose it offended this GM that I didn't fawn to his tune. I had opened our door to him in full and had begun to invite him in when he identified himself as the hotel's General Manager but his aggressive attitude really turned me off. He was now scaring my girl & our dog. I later learned that the name of this aggressive individual is David Smith. Mr. Smith proceeded to pound angrily, with his fists, on our door. This, of course, sent our Yorkie into enthusiastic barking rapture. About five minutes later we took another load of luggage out to our car. We didn't dare leave our now hyper vigilent Yorkie in the room alone so we wrangled him (on a leash) while balancing our suitcases. Imagine how thrilled we were to discover this same man (David Smith) perched on a railing directly beside our path...to confront us again and again. Publicly. Right there in their main lobby. Mr. Smith loudly and repeatedly informed us (yes, right there in the main lobby) that his housekeeper would be closely ""inspecting"" our room for cigarette evidence as soon as we left. I was disgusted & surprised that this arrogant and abusive individual would go so far in his attacks on us. I invited him to inspect our room but I informed him we would be taking videotape footage of our own to document the clean condition of our room at check out. I informed him we would be taking that footage shortly before we turning in our keys. To tell you the truth, we also interviewed our housekeeper. Not having bickered with us enough, this man then complained about the presence of our small Yorkie in our room. I kid you not. As though we had sneaked our dog in. We had booked at this property primarily because their own agents promised it is a ""pet friendly"" property. We even carried our Yorkie right with us as we checked in. We had also carried and walked the little guy out for frequent trips in our cars and relief walks outside. I finally had enough. Here we were, doing our best to load up the considerable amount of gear that a woman, a six year old and a dog accrue on a road trip and this man was somehow getting off on hopping out at us along the way with more and more accusations. So I asked Mr. Smith for the name of his own supervisor. He hotly informed me that he ""answers to no one"" that he is the top. He danced around for a good 5 minutes refusing to provide the name or contact information of any person who might be interested to hear of our experience. It baffles me that The Westin would have a person like this managing one of their properties. Having worked in hospitality for almost twenty years I tell you this, had I been in his shoes, I'd have cut my losses. Having discovered my guest was innocent, I'd have quickly apologized and let it go. It wouldn't occur to me compound a bad taste in a guest's mouth into an entire cupful of slop.",1,0

Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I stayed there for business, so unlike some of the other reviewers I was in bed by about 9:30 every night... The hotel itself was great, the only downside was the location since I did not have a car (hence the four stars). There was not much to walk to in the way of food. Also a Taxi to the strip would probably cost you about 30 bucks if not a little more (it was a $55 cab ride from the airport). The room was laid out extremely well, the perfect size, it felt large and had all of the things you would need for a stay of a week or so. The service was great and the bed was comfortable.... Really what more would you need?",4,1
Element Las Vegas Summerlin,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I love this hotel. I want to shrink it, wrap it up in my carry-on and take it home.

Free breakfast buffet that is good and offers low-fat options. Unlimited good coffee all day. 3. Rooms have sleek stainless steel and glass-tiled kitchenettes that blend seamlessly into the rooms. 4. Bathrooms are elegant and offer the most modern fixtures by Kohler including huge rain-style shower heads in your spacious glassed-in modern shower. 5. Beds are amazingly and delectably comfortable, with about 8 pillows and huge white fluffy comforters. 6.

So myself and 2 others went Friday, September 01. The whole tour was so much fun!!! Carli and Alex were our hosts and they were so much fun and so sweet!! They made us feel completely welcome even though booking was a little hard because of some vouchers we had. They were very good at keeping us updated about where to meet up and the times. Anyway, we got into all of the clubs no problem, there was only like a 5-10 min wait to get into TAO, we cut in front of a sea of people no joke, and no wait besides that for the lounge we went to and for the Chateau. The party bus ride was fantastic!!!! Carli and Alex kept the party going and made sure everyone had a good time and whoever wanted drinks was well taken care of! One of the best parts of the tour to be honest! Unlimited free drinks and they just kept them coming so by the second club my friends and I were having the best time! Idk how the other hosts are, but Carli and Alex were hands down amazing!! Definitely try to go with them if possible. Looking forward to our next trip!!!!!",5,1

Elite VIP Tours,"Tours, Hotels & Travel, Club Crawl, Nightlife, Dance Clubs","My experience was horrible. We only went to 1 club and the bus didn't even take us there. We were already at the location that the club was. They tried to fix it by sending the ""manager"" to present the 1 club and the bottles we paid for but even that was unacceptable. Her breath smelled like she'd just woken up and she had cat fur all over her. It was ridiculous. They did drop us off at our location but the rest of the experience was a mess. I will NEVER recommend this service to anyone! Alex was great. He did all he could but this was not ok. We paid entirely too much for this horrible service",1,0
Elite VIP Tours,"Tours, Hotels & Travel, Club Crawl, Nightlife, Dance Clubs","This is lengthy but to summarize.. WALK AWAY NOW. Literally.. WALK. This Company is very Savvy with words so make sure you have verified several times the details of the itinerary. We expected a Private Party Bus tour of the itinerary of our choosing based on their options. False. This is absolutely a WALKING tour FROM CLUB TO CLUB. If you go into this Party Bus Tour thinking you're going to ELITE clubs and plan to dress to the nine, and ladies in 3 inch heels then please bring yourself a change of outfit to include jeans and hiking boots. This is not worth your $$. Do yourself a favor and waste that $$ on gambling because we are literally walking away from this experience in the hole. We chose a private tour with bottle service and champagne to specific clubs as offered but received a message around 7:30pm the night of informing us there was a change of location and itinerary. We were told to meet the host originally at 9:30pm at the Beer Park but at 7:30 we were told the time changed to 9pm and that our host would be there by 8:45 at Lovo in the Venetian. We rushed to arrive at 8:45 only to receive a text that our host was running 10 minutes late and to head in and have a drink. So we do... 25 more minutes go by and still no host. Several texts went back and forth stating he was outside, and then upstairs, and then back downstairs so we are basically chasing him now at this point to meet. I surely thought we were on hidden video and just being screwed with. Finally around 945 on the dot, and several calls and texts later our host comes strolling in. Now Alex was extremely apologetic for being late and nice but than proceeded to get us into the club that we were just in, ""for free"" There was no cover regardless. Then we're handed 2 4 1 drinks specials that only included rail drinks in a club that was dead. He informed us we would then be walking to the next 3 clubs before being put on the bus at 1230am. We explained to him this is not the impression we were under and so forth which I will take blame for because they don't specifically state its a bus tour but either way, were extremely misleading. To skip the bs, we ask if we can begin the bus tour early because we aren't interested in hiking up and down Vegas in stilettos. This is where I get to meet the horrid Guest Services / Event Coordinator Ive ever had to hold a conversation with. Carlee Collins. It was like speaking with an over privileged 16 yr old drama queen who clearly was never taught discipline or manners. Alex is speaking with her first, and my entire party group can literally hear her going off on the poor chap through the phone about how she doesn't have time for this bullshit bc she is in Miami and to figure it the fuck out... he proceeds to roll his eyes and hands the phone to me just in time for me to hear "" and they fucken paid with a groupon so they can suck my dick"". Sorry we are beneath you Carlee because we used a groupon YOUR company offered...She immediately apologizes for Alex as if he is the problem when its clear he is simply a puppet on her strings and after clarifying we were mislead she tells me this isn't her problem and that we should've read the voucher more carefully because it doesn't state the tour of the club's are by bus and shes in miami. She proceeds to tell me to diffuse the situation I need to google our voucher and read the ""fine lines"" before speaking to her again bc shes been dealing with the SAME issue for 7 years. 7 years with the SAME complaints from your customers?? I asked her for her supervisors number Frank Rizzo and she told me shes the only one who worked there that I could speak with and refused to give it to me. Carlee continues to apologize and pass blame on poor brainless Alex for being late as if that were the only problem... Eventually after a 20 minute convo that included several pauses so she could talk to the group of friends she was out with and then me quoting her ""suck the dick"" comment she agrees to have the bus for us by 11 ""if we're lucky"". Then Alex escorts us in our Vegas Nine attire to the next ""ELITE"" club which is a karaoke dive bar that smelt like stank vagina and again.. 2 for 1 drink specials and no cover for anyone regardless. 11 rolls around and we start a wild goose chase for our supposed bus. after 30 mins of walking from one end of the Venetian to the other and then back. our tour bus rolls up with Mrs. Frizzle herself as the driver. Same good looking tour bus you can get anywhere. We had to play our own music and were taken to the Vegas sign as promised but then were told she has to go drop alcohol off to another bus so we had to wait before the next club. Okay, we give up wheres the hidden camera?? we asked to be taken back to our own hotel instead which put us on the bus for 45 mins total. maayybee. Worse worthless night in Vegas. Thank god Alex at least hooked us with some good recreational activities... Youre cool bro. But Carlee can bite the curb.",1,0
Elite VIP Tours,"Tours, Hotels & Travel, Club Crawl, Nightlife, Dance Clubs","Take the time to read my sweet review of this elite VIP tour. Whatever you do don't expect to get your money's worth. Our party of 9 was thoroughly greeted at the first popping club about 45 minutes later than what was told by a young fella who surely didn't even have his shoes on the right foot. After the frustration of dealing with our disheveled host died down and we received our first 2-4-1 drink special we then were told to start walking. ***this is a walking tour so if you are going to wear your Vegas best make sure pack enough dr scholls and second skin for those 6-inch heels ladies*** Next stop a trashy karaoke bar upstairs at the Venetian. Extremely fun dive bar that would be fun to day-drink in but not the nightclub we were promised. After about 45 min our ""magic school bus"" had supposedly showed up. We refer to it of that name because after our strapping young fellow walked around aimlessly for about 30 minutes trying to track it down we assumed it was non-existent. Once this bus showed up it was as stripper-pole trashy as we expected the only thing this Groupon had promised that actually was true, so I'll give one kudos to bus's stripper pole!! The bus contained one bottle of ciroc and one bottle of jack and few mixers. We also enjoyed our 10.99 champagne (I'm sure if you upgrade you'll get the 15 dollar bottle instead). About twenty minutes into the ride we made it the famous ""welcome to Las Vegas"" sign. Thankfully someone with a professional camera was on spot to take a few photos of us. If I would assume that's where most of our tour money went was to the professional photographer at the sign because that was the only thing worth it on this Awful tour. If you want a headache of an experience then make your way to Elite VIP tours. Not worth the time, not worth the money, not worth the experience!!",3,0

She recommended we start the night off, after we met up, at the Foundation room because the weather had been great and we would be able to get some awesome photos with the amazing view of the strip! I told her we are down to do what ever she recommends! She laid it all out for us and the tour was one for the books. Alex was with us the entire night! He made sure to get great photos of us at foundation room and that we knew when to meet for the next club. He was very easy to talk to and defiantly made the night that much better! We were out partying for the bachelorette party and he did everything he could to make sure we had a good time especially the bride to be! He went above and beyond and I (being the one to plan it all) couldn't be any happier! the party bus was probably the best part of the night thanks to him Doing a privet tour for a large group of drunk girls is the way to go. It was very organized, we didn't feel rushed, we didn't have to worry about how we were getting to place to place. We got to go to multiple places, without a cover, and without waiting in lines. Red Square, Foundation Room (both had drink specials), Lights, party bus with photo at the Las Vegas sign, and last chateau rooftop club in Paris (recommended by Carli).

I wanted to start by saying these guys know what they are doing and how to treat out of town folks. So my wife surprised me with a trip to Vegas with about 14 other people. We started it off meeting at a bar on the strip and had some free drinks (GREAT). I will be honest the rest was just a ton of fun. We hit about 4-5 clubs, drive around in a limo party bus, and went to the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign. These guys do not disappoint!!! At the end of the evening when we were all going our separate ways they we noticed that my wife was missing her ID. They (Elite VIP) went out of their way and off of the clock to take us back to the 1st club to get the ID. They went above and beyond to treat us well and showed us an amazing time.

Elite VIP Tours,"Tours, Hotels & Travel, Club Crawl, Nightlife, Dance Clubs","We booked a tour greater than 10 days before coming to Vegas with this being our high light. They texted me two hours before we were supposed to be there stating that because we did not book 7 days in advance there was no tour space. When I xalled them regarding this error they reported that they actually did not have a tour that night and the computer ""made a glitch."" It was too late by that time to make any other plans for the evening which was unfortunate as we have a very limited time here. All they did was refund us and sent our information to a night club middle man for free entry which now learning after walking the strip we could do ourselves thus it really wasn't a consolation. They did give us credit towards their company but I probably will not be able to get back to the area anytime soon and I'm not sure that it was even a substantial amount. Additionally, after this event I am hesitant to even book with them as this may happen again. I feel like even if it was a glitch they knew about it the minute we booked and we should have gotten a call rather than a text to explain it then. I would have understood and thus had time to plan something else. It looks like fun but essentially book at your own risk.",3,0

We contact elite and I am provided the number of our host and ask me to call her to find out if she is coming (why me as a customers supposed to call our missing host). We call and she indicates she is off for the night. The group then became very concerned. We finally got a host, which was not at all an experience host. She asked for the gratuity in advance, yes in advance after host arrived late. When we questioned it, she said that we were lucky she was able to make it because it was the host birthday and she would be a miserable host if we made her leave her birthday party to come host our night. We asked if there was any drink specials in both clubs we were scheduled to attend and she said that there was no need since we had lots of alcohol on the bus. Then when we finally board the bus, there was no alcohol and we had to ask to stop at a liquor store to buy our own alcohol. The bus had one cooler left over alcohol from a previous party, thats what the host told us. Overall it was an awful expensive experience. All the other group members were as unhappy as us.

I did drink to much cheap vodka on our tour and they didn't let me into the last club, but the host did warn me. I woke up with the worst hang over ever, and didn't remember much, but I looked like I had fun in my pictures. Definitely going through them again. Maybe I'll ask them if I can byob next time cause f cheap vodka and f paying $20 a drink at the club. love that they take you to the Las Vegas sign",5,1
Elite VIP Tours,"Tours, Hotels & Travel, Club Crawl, Nightlife, Dance Clubs","Honestly, we didn't really know what to expect with this tour besides just trying it out. To our surprise, we had a great time this weekend! With Vegas, we can either burn a lot of cash getting bottles to cut the line or wait in line at the popular places. I have friends that know promoters and was able to get on the guestlist but not being a regular there it's hard knowing different people to get you in besides having to spend so much money. Elite VIP is so freaking fun for couple reasons. First... we get free drinks and able to get the party started right in the bus! Secondly, no freaking line! Lastly, if the club sucks and it happens, we get to hop back on the bus and get driven to another place and skip the line again! Anyway, if you're not a regular and just want to check out different clubs in Vegas with great convenience then check them out. We'll definitely do this again.",5,1
Elite VIP Tours,"Tours, Hotels & Travel, Club Crawl, Nightlife, Dance Clubs","This is long, but I would read before booking!!! I did some research and booked this company on September 1st 2015. The price seemed fair and they offered access to a club and party bus ride. They set us up for the following, the girl was nice when booking and our plan was: Cost: $629 plus requested $115 tip to the driver and host. Start at Cromwell for Drink specials Head to Drais (get walked in) Have a 1 hour party bus to the Las Vegas Sign Have 2 bottles of Belvedere and 1 bottle of Champagne. Get walked into Light. Now looking at that and getting better service with another company, I should've known better, the price is NOT worth it. I never got a follow-up call even the day of just receipt of course because they wanted money. I HAD to contact Carli. She of course forgot who I was and had to ""get back to me"" she did call and we were setting up the night AGAIN, which i thought was already set up. A simple review of the bill would clarify that. She called back and forth for a bit and then told us that we were no longer going to Drai's, because her Manager was in China and everything was chaotic (not my problem). This threw a wrench in our plans, because we had to girls flying in who were heading there to meet up. We then had to scramble for a new plan. She said she could do Hyde Bank and Lilly's for drink specials. We had to get OUR own transportation to Belliagio and headed to Lilly's. We met our host there, the girl was nice and accommodating the only positive thing out of the experience, only I expected a well dressed representative to be walking us around and getting us in the clubs. We got 2-1 drink ""specials"" at Lilly's. Talk about a BORING ass place to send 10 dressed up girls. We walked in and walked out. On our way out a promoter from Hyde saw us and offered us a FREE bottle service table and bottle of champagne. We told the girl, if we had any offers besides just entry into Bank or Hyde, she said no, we just get you in.. Hmmm pretty sure I could do that my self, what exactly did $629 pay for??? We went to HYDE and had the BEST time, free table, drinks, great music. We left to go to our ""party bus"" We go to the ""BUS"" and it was just an old free bus they use to take you for free to strip clubs. Pretty much a big limo. We enter the bus.. Where is the 2 Belevedere's and champagne you ask? They ran out.. we are in LAS VEGAS, and they ran out. haha.. they offered a JUG of Kettle and Cooks Champagne. Hmmm that's about $60 bucks.. I complained to the Host and ""Carli"" the VIP host, who told me to google Kettle one and Belvedere to see that its equivalent. OK! let me jump on google and check that out... you Promised on thing and gave another, pretty much the story of the night. We get on the bus and drive to the Vegas sign. For $700 bucks there should have been their own photographer taking pics.. no no, we have to use our cameras. You can not see shit at night with a phone camera, (pics attached) so that was a damn waste. I was texting back and forth with Carli and I told her I was disappointed, she said that it was our fault for choosing a different plan at the club and she can give us a $62 credit.. WOW $62!!! thanks SO MUCH!! We get dropped off and Light, we choose this since we were staying at Mandalay. Another place we could have gotten in by ourselves. Considering no one was in line and we were all girls. I give the host $70 to be fair and we are on our own. We stay for 30 min's and head back to room. Carli said we would discuss it all the next day... Still waiting on that call... This is what this SHOULD cost: Bus for an hour $130 Tip: $100 Booze: $60 = $290 That would be a fair price. $629 NOPE NOT WORTH IT. SAVE YOUR MONEY!! Try another company. You have better luck tipping the guys on the strip for VIP club tickets. You will save hundreds of dollars. I am not satisfied AT all and will be disputing this further.",1,0

I got checked in just in time to enjoy my complimentary cocktails for the evening reception. The ambiance was incredible. I asked the bartender about the books on the bookshelves - they were the real deal, not just a facade made to look like books on a shelf. A little on the pricey side, but worth it. The restaurant served a terrific salmon dinner and the complimentary breakfast hit the spot the next morning. Compared to stays I've had in other cities like Atlanta or Miami, this was a breath of fresh air.",5,1

The restaurant has really good brick oven pizza...I felt bad that I couldn't eat more. I also missed breakfast as I was headed to the airport to track down my suitcase. There also seemed to be a lot to do within walking distance...shops, restaurants etc. It was hard to get a full grasp since that wasn't on my agenda. The room was clean and comfortable...just what I needed after a day in the airport trying to find flights. I'll stay here again if I'm ever back in town. Is it downtown? No, but I was happy.",4,1

I loved how they had a little area for the kids that included a punch and a few snacks for them as well. In regards to the light appetizers for the adults, the chicken salad was amazing! I don't even typically eat chicken salad but it was nice and creamy and just delicious. I will definitely be back. The hotel doesn't have the typically decor I'm used too, but equally as beautiful.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Charlotte Ayrsley,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","Shout out to COURTNEY and the rest of the guest services/house keeping/banquet staff! I had an amazing experience staying here!!! Story time: I stayed for a few days and when I got back to the airport to fly home I realized I forgot a very important booklet of mine that I neeeed for work. I called the hotel to see if they could search my room (already freaking out) and it wasn't there. Within 2 minutes Courtney called me back and told me room service searched but she would personally search herself if it made me feel better and call me back with the results. She did just that and told me it wasn't there. I told her there was a chance it could be in the ballroom then. She apologized as they had already cleaned and aren't on duty on Mondays. She then called just incase and received no answer so she told me she'd search the hotel til she found someone. She did just that and my booklet was found! I was still nervous I wouldnt have it in time but sooo relieved it was found. I told her I'm at the airport and will try and drive back if the gate operator told me there was enough time and informed her if it could be over nighted, it'd be amazing. She told me it was a little late in the day so she'd overnight it tomorrow. That made me a little nervous that it still wouldn't make it in time since I live on the west coast. I called back the hotel to inform them I'm going to try and catch a fast driving uber just incase, and was informed that Courtney didn't answer her phone because she was already on the way to the post office. This is called WORLD CLASS CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! Thank you guys so much! You took me from freaking out to extremely happy. I would recommend this place to any colleagues and friends/family! Courtney, Ashley, Evan, front desk, housekeeping, banquet staff = 5 stars!!! Not to mention, while I was just writing this Courtney called me again out of courtesy that she sent it off and would email me the tracking number. Also, that it is guaranteed to arrive tomorrow night . I'm blown away. God bless! :)",5,1
Embassy Suites by Hilton Charlotte Ayrsley,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","Full disclosure, I am a Marriott Rewards member and typically prefer to stay at their properties when possible. Unfortunately due to several co-workers booking the same hotel I had to go with the majority and book the same hotel, and I have to admit that just like the past Embassy Suites in Tampa this was a pleasant surprise. It wasn't all perfect from the start, I did have problems with check in because Hilton decided to decline the transaction but not notify me which resulted in a delay in getting to my room rather than just going directly to my room and using the Hilton Digital Key within their smart phone app. The problem was my fault, as it was a limitation of my corporate card, which was easily remediated however it did cause some problems and a 15 minute delay at check in. However to make matters worse, all King rooms were having problems with the air conditioning which resulted in me having to go with two queen beds for this trip. The staff did their best to remediate the problem and even presented me with a check in bag, which included a bag of pretzels and two bottles of water. Nice touch! My room was on the Premium Floor, which apparently comes with the added benefits of an in room Keurig, premium Wi-Fi, and access to the premium complimentary vending machine. The room itself was very modern and spacious. The kitchenette was perfect for my stay, and the vending machine allowed me to stock my fridge with water and soda at no cost, nice touch! The living area was nice with a comfortable sofa and large tv. The bedroom was also a nice surprise and very large, the bed itself was also very comfortable and provided an excellent night sleep. Overall this property was nice, as it was conveniently located with a variety of dining options located nearby. Odds are I will be back in town in the future, and I might have to consider this location over the Marriott branded properties and just forgo my points for business trips to Charlotte.",4,1
Embassy Suites by Hilton Charlotte Ayrsley,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","If you're not familiar with Embassy Suites as a brand the deal is: 1) hot, cooked to order breakfast is included with your room 2) evening reception with light appetizers and complimentary cocktails (beer & wine) is also included with your room. 3) your room is a suite (as the name implies). This is one of the top 3 Embassy Suites I have stayed in (and I've stayed in many). This hotel is pretty new and the decor choices were executed fabulously. I had a king suite room thanks to a HHonors upgrade as a Diamond member. My room was really spacious - it had a dining table that seats six, a couch, a huge tv, a gas fireplace along with separate bathroom with both a soaking tub and a shower, and separate bedroom with king sized bed. The walkin closet is roomy and perfect for your luggage. The lobby is welcoming and spacious as well and the cooked to order breakfast and Manager's Evening reception were enjoyable for my 2 night stay.",5,1

Embassy Suites by Hilton Charlotte Ayrsley,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","My company reserved this hotel for us while attending our work conference. This brand new hotel was worth every penny my company spent and I really appreciate them for putting us up in such a nice place! Our driver dropped us off at the front door around 7pm on a Sunday and the front desk clerk greeted us all and checked in a group of 5 of us very easily. After checking in I went into my room and was totally amazed and surprised! I walked into a large sitting area with a sofa, chairs, work table, and a fridge. The next door lead me to a good size bathroom. And then the final door lead me to my spacious bedroom with two beds. There was also a door from my bedroom that lead to the living room. Thank you company work conference! The room was very clean and spacious and the hotel was very nice! My beds were so comfortable and I had ultra soft pillows. I also never heard a peep from the hallway while in my room; I slept like a baby! There is a bar down stairs that offers complimentary drink hour from 5:30-7:30pm for guest. Across from the bar is a restaurant which offered complementary breakfast every morning. And it's not just a cold breakfast, they serve eggs, bacon, omelets, and more. Along with cereal, fruit, bagels, and muffins. The hotel also has an indoor pool and a decent work out center. I would soooo stay here again if back in the area!",5,1
Embassy Suites by Hilton Charlotte Ayrsley,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","I have to say, as much as I travel I enjoy a good hotel when I can find one. This new Embassy Suites opened its doors June 2015 and everything is new, clean and top notch. I added an array of photos on Yelp to give you a sense of the hotel. The food in the lobby restaurant is fantastic. Very reasonably priced with large, more than enough for one person servings. Trust me, order the small portions, you will have food left over. The gym is great. The parking lot is shared with the Homewood Suites across the lot. There are plenty of other places to eat around the campus if you're interested. This is not your traditional or average Embassy Suites. They have a new floor plan you will not find in average Embassy Suites. There is a very nice touch of a waterfall that greets you in the lobby. And thank goodness, the coffee stations are the first thing you encounter when you enter the restaurant for the buffet breakfast (6A - 9:30A) in the mornings. The restaurant is closed for lunch but reopens at 5:00PM for dinner. So fellow business travelers this is the place for you when you're in Charlotte.

Emerald Necklace Inn & Tearoom,"Bed & Breakfast, Food Court, Restaurants, Hotels & Travel, Food, Hotels, Tea Rooms, Event Planning & Services","Oh my sweet baby Jesus this place is adorable! I made reservations for a Sunday afternoon tea party. Three lovely ladies showed up in their pearls and hats to enjoy this quaint place full of soft, colorful, feminine decor. There were other patrons (little girls, couples, older clientele). Staff was friendly; our young, new on the job, waitress tried her best to be pleasant and satisfy our needs. She even let us tour one of the rooms they rent out and told us about how this old building was involved in the underground railroad! For food/best experience, I went with the Emerald High Tea $25. To begin I got this Georgia O'Keefe cold tea starter in a little jar with a pink sugar rim. Next I got to choose my own pot of loose leaf tea from a large section (I went with the Lady Londonberry). First course was a cup of chopped fruit and a slice of cheddar, tomato, broccoli quiche. (By the way, the goods were served on pretty china that your grandma Doris would love). Second course I chose a cute looking salad of mixed greens, fruit, and crunchy noodles (you can get a cup of soup instead of salad). Third course included finger sandwiches like cucumber with cream cheese, chicken salad, and egg salad. I also received a blueberry scone, two mini slices of bread (I think one was blueberry and one zucchini?), and spreads like Devonshire cream and lemon curd. The last course was all about dessert with a chocolate covered cherry, chocolate covered grape, lemon madeleine, frosted brownie, and a mini cheesecake. Individually all are small portions, but collectively it's a filling meal. I really enjoyed my experience here, everything was just lovely (minus this awful caramel apple tea that I tasted). You can come here to enjoy bed and breakfast accommodations, for a tea party, or even for the ice cream parlor that they have. The backyard connects to the Rocky River Reservation so you can go for a stroll through nature. I would highly recommend you check out Emerald Necklace Inn for an enjoyable experience!

We have visited several tea houses in the area, but this was our first visit to Emerald Necklace. It makes me sad that I didn't even know it was here- the building is so easy to miss if you're not paying attention. I love the fact that this building is so old. It immediately presents a certain kind of charm and an age where things were much more simple. The décor inside is exactly what you'd hope from a tea room. I wish I could have seen the guest bedrooms! The table was set with all the usual accessories and we were greeted immediately by the owner, Gloria. It is very clear that Gloria pays close attention to detail and enjoys what she does. She went over the menu and the history of the Emerald Necklace Inn and really welcomed us. We even got a sample of a new fall apple cider tea and we sampled the aroma of all the tea we inquired about. We settled on a pot of Rooibos Very berry Blend. It was perfect for us- she kept checking on the pot and making sure the strength was right. We started with a soup (tomato rice for me) and an adorable salad for Mom. Should salad be adorable? It is here. My favorite part was definitely the scone with Devonshire cream and a delicious lemon curd. Banana bread was also tasty. Next we had tea sandwiches- all very nice sizes, traditional and delicious. I was expecting a little cream puff or something simple for dessert- but WHOA! We got a trifle of chocolate mousse, cherries, and chocolate sauce. Served with a chocolate spoon! It's the details, people, that make all the difference for me.

The car needed new windshield wipers, as I found out during a torrential rainstorm in TN, and the tire pressure gauge light was on for the whole trip home. Now if Enterprise would sell this car to me for a great price, I would buy it!! However, I hope that whoever trashed the inside was held responsible.

Enterprise Rent-A-Car,"Hotels & Travel, Car Rental","I reserved a car onilne via Enterprise's 800-number. I was told my car would be $57 for a three-day rental, including fees and taxes. When I got to the local office to pick up my car, I was told that I needed insurance. Okay, that's fine. The man at the desk told me the rate was (his words) ""Seven dollars a day."" He said this at least twice. Over the course of the conversation, that became ""$25 for three days."" I didn't think much of that, because ""seven dollars a day"" works out to close to ""$25 for three days."" And when I got the actual receipt, it was $25 for EACH day. And as we all know, ""$25 for three days"" is very different from ""$25 a day."" In addition to that, my rental was a little more than the $57 I was quoted on the 800-number. Not much more, but enough to make it not right. So, my $57 rental, plus $7/day insurance, should have been about $78. Instead, my total was about $129. Bottom line, Enterprise can't be trusted. Not at this location, at least. I will never use them again, and plan to talk to the Better Business Bureau about their business practices when I return to town on Monday.",1,0

We contacted and took the car back to this dealership....they had to order new parts for A NEW CAR !They called us in less than week later that the part is in for us to come in -we had to wait for their shuttle and basically took a full day ...we came to p/u and they told us that actually only 1 out of 2 parts came in so we have to do this again in a week or two! Every time we went there they had problems finding the car key under our name (we later found out that the car was still registered under their dealership). We had to go to this dealership 10 x and numberous phone calls, emails and extreme stress .... every time we got there to p/u our ""fixed"" new car -something else was wrong with it (cabin lights were not working, gas tank was not opening etc). Finally they said that it is all done (after over 1 month going back and forth)we got there only to find out that the car was back to square one-with the same problem we dropped the car off with !!! They were clearly struggling fixing this faulty car and chose not to give us a refund or to give us another car -as this car was still under their dealership name and was not registered under ours yet. This time they kept the car for full 3 weeks ! We finally got Our BRAND New car - which needed a number of new parts ordered and help from the Chrysler's technician . Fianlly after almost 7 weeks we received our Brand new-fixed car! The magament and the owner are not professional AT ALL ! They are so fake -they just want to sell you a car -pretending that you are ""like their family"". I would never ever reffer anyone to this dealership...they are wasting everyone's time ! This is our 2nd new car we bought here -we had no real issue with the 1st car so never had to deal with the management only with the mechanics- but this time it was the Worst experience to deal with the owner and the management at this dealeship.There is ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SERVICE ! No emails responses from the management-the have NO manners and no idea how to deal with clients. Owner is the worse we ever had to deal with !",1,0

My husband has bought several cars here over the years, but they never have any record of him in their system when we go for service. This weekend we showed up for a service appointment, which we had made a week in advance (2 of us were on speaker phone when the appt was made, and we instantly put it in our calendars), but when we arrived, they had no record of an appointment being made. We waited 2 hours before they were able to look at our car, and then they charged us just for looking at it. Customer service here SUCKS.

I would rather have my family sleep in our car or drive home than have to stay at this place again! We arrived to find a trash bag in the corner of the lobby, tape marks on the front desk, and typed signs posted with near-threatening verbiage describing their queen vs. full bed policies. The front desk clerk was adequate, although he was on his cell phone when we arrived and was very quick to return to his call after we left. We proceeded to the elevator, and as the doors shut, we noticed some nasty streaks on it as if someone had wiped it with a very dirty rag. I was trying to keep an open mind about the place after reading many of the negative reviews, but when we entered our room, we were greeted with the stale scent of cigarette smoke. My kids started going through the drawers and cabinets like they always do when we first arrive at a hotel, and they discovered a half-empty bottle of lemonade in the refrigerator and an empty beer box in one of the cupboards. A thick layer of dust hung from the light fixtures. It was like their housekeeping staff had better things to do than housekeeping. You had one job, people, ya know? I checked both the mattresses for bed bugs and didn't see any, so I thought we'd be fine. We were only staying over night to avoid a 2 hour drive very early in the morning, and if the place was just a little dirty, we could deal with it. The next morning we awoke and went down to their ""Grab and Go"" breakfast, noticing the same streaks on the elevator doors as the evening before. When we got down to the lobby, we were sorely disappointed. They do NOT offer a continental breakfast like you'd get at other hotels, despite what they say on their site. It was literally just coffee, oatmeal packets, and two baskets of packaged muffins and granola bars that they kept BEHIND THE DESK, which is not surprising because I'm sure their guests have tried to take three or four of each given the lack of any other food. They did not even have fruit or milk or yogurt or cereal for the kids. We left around 6:30 AM and were on our way to an event in Pittsburgh. When we returned home later that afternoon, my six-year-old son wanted to get a bath, and when we undressed, I was absolutely horrified to find roughly a dozen bed bug bites on his leg. I asked him when he had first noticed them, and he said he had been itchy throughout the night. We gathered everything we had with us and immediately took it to the laundry room to wash in hot water. We even vacuumed the floor under and around the suitcase and washed our bed sheets for safe measure. I left a voice mail and sent an email to Extended Stay America and have received no response back. This is one of the worst hotel experiences I've had, and unless you are one of those people from Hoarders who doesn't mind dirt and bugs and whatnot, I would stay clear of this place.

Apparently, people also live in this hotel and pay by the week.

Likes: -A lot more food vendors than Toronto's Union station. It had a nice, large food court with at least 20 stalls and seating aplenty. -It has real stores in it, like Staples and the Quebec version of Mac's convenience store (though the name escapes me right now). -when you come in from the entrance, it's very easy to see where the Via boarding lines are whereas at Union, you have to work your way through some confusing path as if you are in an airport. Dislike: -Minor for me, but could be significant for everyone else. When boarding the train, it is all steps and no ramps which could cause issues with heavy luggage. Overall, a very clean decent central station (hence the name I guess). :-)",4,1
Gare Centrale de Montréal,"Transportation, Hotels & Travel, Train Stations, Public Transportation","The Gare Centrale is a nice train station. It has a great location for many hotels and restaurants in Montreal. It is also conveniently linked to the metro and bus system of the city. There is a blessed lack of general chaos here. The space doesn't feel suffocatingly crowded, and there are enough places to get a meal or coffee while waiting for your train.",4,1

Getting there from the Bonaventure metro is a bit of a hassle, but just follow the signs and you'll be fine.",4,1
Gare Centrale de Montréal,"Transportation, Hotels & Travel, Train Stations, Public Transportation","Now this train station should get 4 stars for the ease of access and direct connection to several hotels, subway trains and a food court that will put a lot of so called gourmet food courts to shame in other cities. I didn't get to admire the architecture as my exposure to this spot has been limited to just walking across to take the subway or waiting in line as I left the room merely 15 min before boarding. From what I saw they had Premier Maisson (one of the better bakery I have been to North America), some other quick grab and go spot and a Staples. The directions can be a bit confusing at first but I have got my bearings down for Montreal so after a bit of reading around it wasn't hard to navigate this place. For a short weekend trip I think the this option is very viable provided one plans ahead.",4,1
Gare Centrale de Montréal,"Transportation, Hotels & Travel, Train Stations, Public Transportation","I really like this train station. We took the train from Quebec city, stopped by Montreal, Ottawa, and then ended in Toronto. So I've seen 4 train stations in Eastern Canada, and this is one of the best ones. The location is great, and the station is very clean. It is only couple blocks away from Rue Catherine, a street full of shopping stores. Everything is well labeled so it is easy to get around and find the train. The trains are always on time so make sure you give yourself enough time to get to the train station.",4,1

Pour cette raison, je rate rarement l'occasion de passer par la gare centrale, malgré son nombre pathétique de liaisons avec le reste du monde. Juste l'ambiance de son hall principal, les tableaux d'affichages et ses passants me donne envie de prendre le premier train en partance (Deux-Montagnes? OK peut-être pas le premier train!).

There are a bunch of little restaurant stalls, a number of shops, an office supply, and it connects to the metro under-ground. They seem to be usually on time and the staff are okay at communicating any problems. Something I think is pretty awesome: the bathrooms are clean! It seems amazing considering the number of people that come and go on a daily basis. I wish there was wi-fi throughout the station and not just a small area...it can be inconvenient if you only have a few moments to spare but need to connect.",4,1
Gare Centrale de Montréal,"Transportation, Hotels & Travel, Train Stations, Public Transportation","As a frequent user of this train station back in '06 when I was living in QC I visited this station at least eight times that year. As a rushed traveller, I never took in the train stations' beauty. On on a recent visit to the 514, I spent sometime here. Gare Central is the Cadillac of train stations in Canada. This place is gorgeous. It's expansive and airy and a truly beautiful building. Take a moment from your commute to x place and take in how pretty the space is. Beyond that there are tons of places to eat - Montreal does food courts well and Gare Central is no exception - poutine, lots of ethnic options, Mickey D's and a few healthy choices as the station is connected to the underground. There are quite a few shops as well to keep you busy if you have some time to kill - notably a giant Bureau en Gros (Staples), SAQ (liquor store), Carleton Cards, Bentley and even a dollar store. Seating isn't great if you have a some time to kill so I recommend getting a beverage and a snack at Second Cup. Lots of place to sit, people watch and a killer vantage point of the train schedule. All aboard please.",4,1

Gare Centrale de Montréal,"Transportation, Hotels & Travel, Train Stations, Public Transportation","I'm currently writing this review from the train itself..we've just gone through Belleville, ON station en route to Toronto from Montreal. This is my second time taking VIA roundtrip and really experiencing Canadian rail travel (with the exception of VIA's long distance trains to Vancouver and Halifax, haha)..I have to say that I am never not rather impressed by the comfort, level of service, and organization of this company as opposed to Amtrak which though I still love it, has a lot of improving to do and could take a few lessons from VIA Rail Canada. We're speeding at say maybe 95 mph down the ""Corridor"" towards Canada's largest city and I'm quite enjoying myself. The conductor/travel rep has been incredibly cheery and polite and has made the trip that much nicer, I've enjoyed a cup of tea and have decent room for my legs and computer bag. I didn't scramble for a place to put my little suitcase upon boarding in Montreal as the areas at the end of the coaches for baggage are quite a bit larger than those on Amtrak. The WiFi on board these trains is actual reliable and consistent unlike the rather pathetic form of it that they have on Amtrak. I believe that the router is actually ON BOARD the train on VIA like it is also ON BOARD the buses like Greyhound and Bolt Bus (USA only) unlike Amtrak which relies on service towers proximate to the tracks (how proximate, we don't know) which don't guarantee connectivity that would allow you to get work done or whatnot. Even if there isn't a router in each car on this train, it is still worlds better than Amtrak's and even those on the buses. Boarding staff in Montreal were very pleasant and helpful. They didn't have the ""this is my job and get lost"" attitudes that I am so used to..VIA rail cars are very clean which is something you don't always get with Amtrak. Mind you, this review is not meant to dis Amtrak, it's just that I am from the US and am a student in Montreal right now and Amtrak's Adirondack service from New York to Montreal is what I have to draw upon. Rail travel seems to be more of a priority in Canada than in the US. This won't be my last trip on VIA for sure. I love trains and taking the train and this is partially why.",4,1
Gare Centrale de Montréal,"Transportation, Hotels & Travel, Train Stations, Public Transportation","There is something so nostalgic about taking the train, especially in Canada where so much of our history is bound up with the expansion of railway ties and the possibilities these tracks opened up across our huge spaces. In Montreal the Gare Central is a gorgeous, cavernous, partially underground space that is surprising to the first time visitor. You can access it from the Banque Nationale entrance on Rene-Levesque but this is not clearly indicated until you are already through the front door. Taxis come in through the entrance on De La Gauchetiere, and pedestrians can come in that way as well but it's a bit chaotic with all the cars and cabs. Once inside, the space is so lofty and enormous it's hard to imagine how it all fits under the stately old Queen Elizabeth hotel and bank tower. There is a fairly large food court that connects to the other underground malls and includes a nice mix of smaller cafes and larger chains (the obligatory Tim Hortons, and the slightly unexpected Bureau En Gros.) The large central area where passengers line up to board their trains is all brass and marble and neo-classical art like a good train station should be, and feels like a healthy mix of old timey travel and modern convenience. The real standout of the whole experience is the train staff. Everyone from the people at the ticket counters to the porters and conductors are friendly, bilingual, professional, chivalrous and dapper in their trim hats and flapping trench coats. The food on the train is maybe one small notch above most plane food, but the seats and aisles are much more spacious and the view of rolling farmlands, lakes and small towns is good for the heart, I'm sure of it.",4,1

Graduate Tempe,"Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","I was a guest at this hotel in April and stayed for 1 night. They stay and restaurant were just fine, unfortunately I left with a very bad experience. We requested a paid for a much later checkout, my infant daughter was taking a nap. Several members of the housekeeping crew were in the hallway, eager to get into our rooms. We finally checked out and in the hustle of getting out with the baby and all of our gear I left my Rolex Submariner watch. I know exactly where it was left, there were some frosted glass shelves in the bathroom at eye level. I foolishly remember leaving it there and it catching my eye later and me thinking that isn't the greatest spot. My wife saw it and had the same thought. This happened on a Monday and unfortunately I only realized the watch was missing on Thursday. I couldn't find it and knew exactly where I left it. I immediately called the hotel and the front desk attendant let me know that nothing had been turned in. I requested to speak to the GM (Mark Hayes) and was told he was on vacation. I received and call back from Garrett Schultz. He assured me that this would be given top priority and they begin looking into it. They had records of all employees that entered the room so it would be easy to find who from housekeeping was in the room after I left. I also spoke with the Tempe police department and filed a report. The detective said he would go to the hotel and interview the employees. Garrett let me know that they would fully cooperate and do whatever they could. I was also contacted by Mark Hayes after he returned from vacation and he let me know they were conducting an internal investigation. Things went quiet and I followed up as there was no news. I received a police report and it was noted that when the detective went to the property Garrett and Mark did NOT allow him to interview the employees. Given that he had to close the case. I received no update on the internal investigation and my last email to them was ignored. Clearly they didn't take this seriously and seemingly brushed it off. There is no doubt in my mind that one of their employees stole my Rolex. I have a lot of family in the area who were happy to refer clients to the hotel and everyone is very soured after hearing my experience with this very serious situation. I would never treat a client the way they did.",1,0

I can't remember when I was ever at a restaurant this bad. I had chicken tacos and the small pieces of diced chicken were so dry that I needed a water chaser to swallow. My friend ordered the Chicken Tortilla Soup. When I think of soup, I imagine a broth or broth like consistency. This was literally like someone opened a can of tomato puree and put in a bowl. You could pick it up with a fork. The entrees run about $11 - $12. Not worth it for 2 dry chicken tacos and soup that's more like salsa. The vodka was good though. You would need quite a few of those to not notice how bad the food is.",1,0
Graduate Tempe,"Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels, Hotels & Travel",Dog friendly and awesome Bark Box and check in. A + My main draw here! There was a lovely woman I've seen at check in a couple times I've been here (one was evening at 11/14) so sweet and nice to my dog. Helped me get my work packages to my room from the back (94 pounds worth). Felt very welcome. Overall a fan. One odd thing is the $7 a day parking when I see ASU students literally parking and walking with backpacks across the street to class (for sale signs on car and sun devils stickers) - not hotel guests or workers ---I have to pay and they don't? My job is paying so I'm not making a stink about it. Everything else is awesome. Noticed a review about room 101 before me - my review is it's great. Yes you can hear people in the evening at times but I put on the fan low and it's fine. I've stayed in lots of hotels and this place is fine with noise most of the time.

Checked in and out toilet was plugged. Called them to come up and fix and left for the day. Came home after being gone all day and room had not been serviced. So we called down and asked for plunger. Got ready and went out that night. Before we left I told front desk toilet still having issues. I told them not plugged but won't flush. Came home that night NOTHING had been done.

Graduate Tempe,"Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","I stayed for 2 nights sponsored by the NFL for a halftime performance. Waited almost 2 hrs after 3pm for our rooms to be ready, no apology or compensation. During the wait, the creepy mustache shuttle driver awkwardly approached our vicinity several times trying to guess what we wanted and keep us away from the front desk, like some creepy protective move on behalf of the receptionist. I didn't have the heart to tell him he had no chance with her. The rooms were cute with a nice AC unit. Sponsor covered room and meals charged to the room, so my meals were limited to the Normal Cafe and the Tapacubo. Normal Cafe: I ordered the cob salad. After 45 minutes of reminding the waitress for water refills, the food came out staggered so we could watch each other eat with the gaze of a ravished wild animal. The salad was covered with a 2 inch layer of unidentifiable bitter orange vegetable cubes. My guess is squash. I powered through half the salad until I felt sick. Every bite was increasingly bitter and hard to swallow. Tapacubo: We ate here quite a few times and tried most things on the menu. Every new order was a desperate attempt to find something not as disgusting as the last order. My personal favorite was the veggie flauta where I met again with the notorious bitter orange squash cubes. I picked up the floppy uncooked tortilla filled with watery veggies. Warm water gushed onto my plate and my lap. The first bite made me gag. My friend didn't believe my gag was genuine so he tried it and gagged too. The rest of the menu was barely tolerable or just bland. Good luck. Woke up in the morning with my phone dead. The lamp ac plug only works if the lamp is on. I should have known, as most people like to sleep beneath an incandescent light. Who knows how many dead phones have left those rooms. A moment of silence for those who had to improve their social skills without the aid of facebook and clash of clans.",1,0

The new room had problems with the sheets also. It's not a comfortable place to stay at all. Feels like a motel and with the school right across the street (ASU) it feels like a cheap party place.

Graduate Tempe,"Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Loved my three nights stay at the Graduate! From the warm greeting, I received when I checked-in to the tacky trendy in the dessert decor, to the awesome location, everything is casual cool fun at the Graduate! You can stay at nicer hotels that are more corporate, but the boutique feel makes the experience 10X more fun especially when you're traveling for work. We spent one day using the conference room and they had the best cookies at our refreshment bar which I ate possibly by the dozen. One huge downside though was the weight room which was basically a closet with a treadmill and a few weights. Don't get me wrong, I know that hotels don't often have the most amazing workout gyms, but this was beyond sad. Luckily one of our managers arranged for us to experience rooftop yoga with Core Power and it really made my morning! If you're in town checking out the university or simply looking for a reasonably priced hotel with lots of charm, be sure to consider the Graduate!",4,1
Graduate Tempe,"Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","I booked two rooms for one night for my family and myself. It was easy to find look for the bright blue Neon sign that says hotel. When walking in I was greeted by the two ladies in the front however it didn't really look like they like there job. They where polite but never gave any additional customer service. I was early for check in, so only one room was available. So my family left our luggage in my room and got ready to go to the pool. When going to the pool there where fresh towels and lounger chairs with umbrellas. We had brought down from the room our own adult beverages. Well that's where this review went from a 4 star to a 3 star. There is no waitress at the pool and there are no signs around the pool stating no outside beverages. The waiter from inside the restaurant came outside and told us there where no outside beverages allowed on the premises. I will completely understand the rules if one there are signs and if two there is a waitress at the pool taking orders but seeing that this establishment is not a Vegas pool and under staff it is very inappropriate for me to walk into the restaurant in my bathing suite wet. After the rude customer service we left the 100^ weather and left to get ready for the Dodger game. After coming back from a 12 inning losing game. We brought back tacos with fear of being told no outside food in the hotel we ate our tacos in front of the hotel in the 100^ weather. Come the next morning we checked out early to avoid the restaurant and have brunch at a more welcoming location. All in all the rooms are very unique. The beds are comfortable and for the price I couldn't have asked for more but like anything in the hospitality industry it's all about customer service and for the hotel not being packed full I don't see how my family and I received such horrible service.",3,0

The gym on the first floor near the elevators is small, but open 24 hours and is very clean and machines are modern.

Graduate Tempe,"Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","I really enjoyed the Graduate Tempe. They spent a ton on remodeling the place, and I gotta say: #NAILEDIT. Let's talk rooms: Not huge, but nicely sized. Luxe bathroom soaps and shampoo (Malin+Goetz), so no need to lug your expensive bottles with ya. We had the king rooms with a little balcony which, hey, it's always nice to enjoy a little alone outdoor time. The beds are super comfy and they don't penny pinch on those pillows. Hipster decor, a mini fridge and a nice flat screen tv. I'm gushing, guys! Note: This isn't an upscale W. This is more like The Ace style hotel. Hip more than luxurious. *** Note: My company paid a group rate. Note: I know nothing about Tempe/Phoenix area and have nothing to compare this to. Not only are the rooms great, but the pool isn't shabby. A ton of space to lay out and even some ice cold water and margarita service from the adjacent bar/restaurant. The pool happens to be open 24 hours. Score. Hot tubbing at 3am? CHECK. They do have an onsite Mexican restaurant/bar that is solid. Not the best Mexican, more of the decent/ a bit healthyish gringo style Mexican. Regardless, pool + marg = pure happiness. The conference room is a delight. A ton of natural light making sitting in there for 8 hours not horrible. The rooftop bar wasn't open while we were there, but man, if it was, I'd of been all over that. A great vista, a huge space, well designed. Hell, a great place for a wedding/birthday party/you name it. We ended up doing some morning rooftop yoga there from the local CorePower studio and it was a total win. Service is wonderful, the space is wonderfully designed and it definitely felt more like a vacation stay vs a work stay, which I mean that's the dream, right? 5 stars, Graduate. Stay fresh.",5,1
Graduate Tempe,"Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","An up-converted campus hotel with a hyper-specific theme? Seems like one of those old tropes that's a recipe for mediocrity. But the folks behind The Graduate nailed it. It's not just the slick design elements, the cool branding, or the fact that it has a sunny pool. What really makes this hotel shine is the attention to detail. First off, my room was CLEAN. That's better than I can say for a lot of hotels I stay in, and I stay in a ton of decently expensive hotels. Really, I could end the review there. Clean rooms are hyper important. But on top of the cleanliness, the rooms were cozy, comfortable, well appointed, and had all the features a traveler would need. Free wifi, mini-fridge in the room, TV, desk, plenty of charging options, shower (bonus -with a door that closes - learn something, SF hotels!), and friendly front desk staff. The style of decor? Totally fun. And the carpet! That merits a nice review on its own. Great carpet designs all over the hotel. The pool is small, but it does the trick. You can get drinks from the bar at the pool. And as a bonus, it's open 24 hours. Only real downside is the lack of substantial fitness room, but I'm told they'll give you a pass to use the ASU facilities just down the street. Bonus! Loved my stay here. Would definitely return!",5,1
Graduate Tempe,"Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","I can't even tell you how badly I wanted to steal the desert animal throw pillow from the bed but I refrained. Probably only 10% of the refraining came from being a non-degenerate while the other 90% of the reason I didn't steal the pillow was because A. It wouldn't fit in my carry on, and B. there was so much cool stuff in the room/hotel I would've felt I was cheating the other stuff by not stealing them away with me, too. It's connected to a cute little modern-ish diner called The Normal and an excellent taco bar called Tapacubo, but beyond that I don't think this area is too much of a happenin' place. Luckily, I was here for work and scheduled from morning through night so I needn't worry about growing bored. Plus, they have a nifty little pristine pool and hot tub that I 100% would have been fine spending my entire stay at. Oh, there's also a rooftop bar area where they sometimes host rooftop yoga (we took a class and it was super fun) and probably the best and least stuffy conference room I've ever been in. Large floor to ceiling windows facing the world, coffee and snack bar, and a giant projector with probably the best picture display I've ever seen.

Was there for the Rock n Roll Arizona as an invited guest - breakfast is not provided but on race morning they provided us with a bag containing a few breakfast items & bottle of water.

I have stayed in countless hotels across the US and most are boring without any character. This place is quite the contrary. The Graduate has this fun Hipster-College-Americana vibe. I absolutely loved it. I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights, so I got to know the ins and outs of this place. The rooms are extremely clean and comfortable. The staff are very nice and helpful. And their restaurant, The Normal Diner, had great service and really good food. I will be back!",5,1

However, once I got to the airport, I received an text from HeadOut advising that they will pick me up at 1 pm (a full 3 hours later!) I texted back to ask ""what happened to 10 am..."" and was told that I was a single passenger and had to go based on availability. Turns out the same thing happened to another passenger on the same shuttle, who was just as upset as I was of the unexpected 3-hour delay. When I asked the driver what the time was changed, he said he didn't know. This was the most aggravating experience I have ever had in traveling.

Head Out To Rocky Point Mexico,"Transportation, Airport Shuttles, Tours, Travel Services, Hotels & Travel","My best friend and I decided to take a shuttle to meet up with my parents at the Mayan Palace for a few days. We were a little nervous about what and who would show up (picturing a non-air conditioned van packed with strangers). We couldn't have been farther from reality. A modest, but clean 12 person van (with AC!) arrived at our door a few minutes early and we were greeted by David. He told us to take our time, as we finished our mimosas and he took care of all of our suitcases. We shared the van with only one other woman who was headed home to her place in Mexico. David was an absolute gem. He played country music and put up with our car-eoke and ridiculous banter. David has a limo license so we were good to have a drink in the back as we made our way to the boarder. We got through the border with no problem. David was obviously a veteran of these roads and maneuvered is through towns and roads with no issues. He even played tour guide and gave us some info about the area and cool places to see and visit. My friend and I had a blast and could have driven around all day, but we made it to our hotel in about 4ish hours ( with a few stops). David met my parents who also felt all his good vibes and we said our goodbyes. Huge thank you and all the praise to David for being a great start to an awesome trip. Thanks ""head out""!",5,1
Head Out To Rocky Point Mexico,"Transportation, Airport Shuttles, Tours, Travel Services, Hotels & Travel","We used Head Out to Rocky Point for a trip over the 4th of July weekend and I am very impressed! We chartered a 12 person passenger van with a small trailer to take us to, and from RP over the holiday weekend. It was $100 per person plus tipfor the trip there and back and was totally worth it. Our driver, David, was very nice, he helped us load and unload our trailer and kept us informed of stops and any necessary border info we needed to be aware of. The trailer was a nice touch as well, we were able to store all our luggage and not be cramped in the van as well as had room to bring our own lawn games, chairs, and any other items allowed across the border. Head Out to RoPo was totally worth it. On the way back, we were able to skip past at least 90 min of a line of cars and the border guards joked with us as we unloaded our personal baggage because of the great rapport Head Out to RoPo drivers have with them. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was the van we rode in needed some attention. The suspension or shocks were bad and the van often felt like a roller coaster so beware if you get car sick easily. Will definitely use them again for our next trip!",4,1

Head Out To Rocky Point Mexico,"Transportation, Airport Shuttles, Tours, Travel Services, Hotels & Travel",Incredible service. I selected them based on a referral from a co worker. Used Mike and Lynelle for round trip transportation to Rocky Point with my family. Will be using them for every future trip my family takes down to Rocky Point. Lynelle was our driver and she is so friendly - our whole family loved her. The pick up times were exactly at the committed times and the communication was great.,5,1
Head Out To Rocky Point Mexico,"Transportation, Airport Shuttles, Tours, Travel Services, Hotels & Travel","I can't speak more highly of Lynelle and the shuttle service that she provides from Rocky Point/Puerto Peñasco, Mexico. I found myself at the very last minute needing to get an emergency passport (mine had expired two weeks prior to this trip. doh), book a flight from Phoenix (the nearest international airport to Puerto Peñasco since the international airport there is presently being built and won't be completed for another two years) to SFO, and get a shuttle from Puerto Peñasco to Phoenix. I called the small handful of shuttle services available to tourists visiting Puerto Peñasco and needing a way back to the U.S. They were all (and by ""all"" I do mean like the 2 or 3 available) expensive and impersonal and were not providing or offering exactly what I needed, nor where they willing to be flexible and work with me to gain my business. I called Lynelle after browsing her website and she was wonderful. She explained to me how her shuttle service worked, the cost, logistics, etc. We made arrangements to have her pick me up at a specific time from my hotel on a specific date and drop me off at the Phoenix airport. Perfect. She sent me an email confirmation. She ran my credit card when she said she would. On top of that, Lynelle was early to pick me up. Her van was new, air-conditioned and very clean. She provided trail mix and granola bars as snacks as well as cold still and mineral bottled water and reading materials about Rocky Point and the local points of interest/the Sonoran desert. Rocky Point/Puerto is a place with an eclectic mix of local Sonorans and expat gringos from Arizona who love it there, live there or at least have summer homes there and spend extensive vacations there. Lynelle is one of those gringo expats who divides her time between her home in Phoenix and her condo in Rocky Point. She is an entrepreneur who saw a need for a service in the community that needed to be provided and wasn't being provided well so she started this shuttle service. She loves Rocky Point and understands that people who visit it will not love it or come back if they are not provided with excellent service while there or to/from there. She is happy to work with you and provide you with a very excellent way to travel to/from Phoenix, Arizona and Rocky Point. Past that, she is a wonderful lady with a really interesting life story and she's so affable and interested in you. I felt safe with her when she picked me up at my hotel and we drove for roughly 4 hours through the beautiful Sonoran desert of Mexico, across the border and into Southern Arizona. (Side note: I was staying at the Mayan Palace a new resort a good distance out of the center of town, like 20 minutes driving distance and the other shuttle services I called charged a considerable amount extra to make a pick-up stop at the Mayan Palace. Lynelle did not. The cost she quotes you is all inclusive and she really is a door-to-door shuttle service provider.) Honestly, I can't say more about how wonderful her door-to-door shuttle service was. I would recommend Head Out to Rocky Point shuttle service to anyone needing to go to/from Puerto Peñasco.",5,1
Herbology Tours,"Health & Medical, Cannabis Dispensaries, Tours, Cannabis Tours, Hotels & Travel, Bus Tours, Cannabis Clinics, Shopping","We got what we wanted out of this tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable and was super helpful in answering our questions. The first dispensary was right on the money with what we were hoping for. Due to some regulations, the 2nd dispensary was bare shelved and out of a lot of the stuff we were interested in. However, the building had other points of interest to hold our attention and to keep the flow of information happening. It would have been nice to see the kitchen where the edibles are made up in full swing but once again, there was a stop in the production due to some regulations or out of stock issues. My only tip would be to call ahead to make sure a business is stocked and ready for customers and that the things you promise to see on the tour are actually up and going. Also, they wanted to stop and eat but we declined due to the fact that we just weren't hungry and had other things we wanted to do since we were only in town for 1 night. Other than that, it was so informational and such a good experience. There was lots of prizes and take away bags full of info. I'm happy that marijuana is actually being looked at for the good it can provide rather than just a dirty drug passed off between shady characters in alley ways. There's a real healing element here and we are only just beginning to tap into the resources of this plant. I'm into holistic healing and have been working in the medical field for 15 years. I have seen some of the healing aspects and I'm hoping that the feds don't shut it down before we can truly see what there is to offer medicine in the future.",5,1

Holiday Inn Club Vacations Scottsdale Resort,"Resorts, Venues & Event Spaces, Vacation Rentals, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","Despite the mixed reviews, our family of 5 had a great experience when visiting Scottsdale for a long weekend in early June. We stayed 3 nights in one of the ""villas,"" which was a large, 2 bedroom apartment on the 2nd floor right in front of the splash pool. We booked on Expedia. The room must have been around 1100 square feet; it was honestly huge. Everything was immaculate, tasteful and well appointed, without excess chachkas and such. The kitchen was very well stocked, with newer, functional cookware, utensils, glassware, appliances, bedding, towels, etc, and again, we were amazed at just how clean and purposeful everything was. Being on the second floor by the splash pool was perfect; we could watch our kids play from the room; the kids really loved it and the slides. There were 3 other nice pools, a bit on the smallish side for a large resort, but none of them were ever too crowded. On site was also what looked to be a decent Mexican restaurant and full feature take out bar (breakfast, coffee, etc.), thought we didn't eat there. The recreation room was also a huge bonus, with a couple of x-boxes, pool table, ping pong, etc. Plenty of stuff to do day and night; we barely left the complex and had some local family visit and eat with US! The grounds were also minimal, but tastefully decorated, and the other vacationers family oriented, nice and respectful - no loud partying, cussing, etc. whatsoever. We DID get 2-3 requests to take the timeshare tour. After prior hellascious experiences elsewhere, we declined every time and they left us alone. Your time isn't worth the $150 they comp you ($75/hr) for that crap. This seems to be where a lot of the complaints lie. Staff at the front desk were super-friendly; we needed to checkout a little later on Monday, and it was no problem. I can't think of a better, more centrally located family resort in Scottsdale. What a value; we'll be coming back!",5,1

We were promised 3 nights for $100 to stay here if we attended a sales pitch for two hours only to find out (when we got there) that they were going to put us in a regular hotel and we still had to attend the sales meeting. The one on one meeting was a joke. We told the guy and his boss we felt like they scammed us. Their response was ""we're sorry we've been getting that lately. We cut ties with our Marketing contractors and that's what's caused this whole mix up."" Then they offered us a measly 5,000 points lol. 5,000 points is about as worthless as a plane with no wings. They're whole business model completely breaks one of God's Ten Commandments and that is lying.

No manager will speak with me, and so far Expedia has not been able to connect with anyone with decision making power through the hotel. Expedia has given be $200 credit for the hassle and has said that this has been an issue with other hotels in the past and they typically refund right away when they customer calls to report a mistake. Unbelievable that Holiday Inn would rather me come and complain to everyone I encounter about how horrible they have been about addressing a mistake.

As a member you can enjoy after hours check-in and everything is arranged in the casita for you as if you are coming back to your second home. The weather is cold here in the winter but the thermostat is set for you as you get into your unit. Scottsdale is a cool town but rather hot in the summertime so I don't mind a little chilly outdoor weather. We have enjoyed our stay at other locations. I love that these units are brand new compared to the resort in Vegas but the 2nd bedroom in the suite only has a full size mattress. The scottsdale suites are larger than the ones in vegas.

Holiday Inn Club Vacations Scottsdale Resort,"Resorts, Venues & Event Spaces, Vacation Rentals, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","DO NOT PURCHASE A PRE-PAID VACATION PACKAGE FOR THIS RESORTE!! I paid $279 on July 1, 2016 for a 5 day 4 night stay at the Scottsdale Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites OR the Holliday Inn Vacation Resort in Scottsdale if it is available. I was told that upon taking the 2 hour tour of the Scottsdale Resort I would receive a refund of my $279 and a $100 voucher to be used at any Holliday Inn property at a later date. When I called to book the Resort in August 15th, I was told that it was NEVER an option to stay at the Resort itself and that we would NOT have access to any of the amenities there. I was told that I could only stay at one of the 4 selected Holliday Inn Hotels. I proceeded to book the Scottsdale North - Airpark for November 19th to the 23rd. At that time I was told that I would have to pay taxes on my stay, which I was never told before. When I booked my reservation on August 15th, I was told that I had 24 hours to cancel without charge. When I received the Confirmation email August 18th, it had the wrong information on it and showed that I would get $249 back after the tour and no $100 certificate. The killer is that they wanted me to pay $19.99 cancelation fee to cancel or change the reservation so I could have time to dispute the charges. I called Holiday Inn Club Vacation customer care to correct the information 3 times. The first two times I was put on hold and after being on the line 15 minutes I was disconnected. The third time I was told that there was nothing they could do and that I would have to contact customerreview@holidayinnclub.com. I emailed customer review and requested my original $279 cash back because I was given the wrong information when I made the purchase. I was told that what I purchased was not nor ever was an option. I submitted the original email that I received showing what I was told I purchased and the email after booking the stay with the lesser amounts on it. They still refused to make changes. I contacted Mater Card who sided with Holiday Inn because the package is ""non-refundable"". It seems it doesn't matter how much the sales person lies to you (even with an email confirming the lies) that if you pay you will never get your money back from these people.

No real biggie. We had to agree to attend a sales pitch/tour presentation which is scheduled for our last day here, hmmm. Okay. Getting out of the car, we noticed no entrance to our building off the lot. We had to lug our things around the building and down 8 steps., no elevator or ramp. We went to our room which I refer to as a hole. Down stairs, our patio was a view of the car front grills in the parking lot. Not going to sped much time there. We went out to dinner, came back to get ready for bed. Turned down the bed to find blood stains on the sheets!! Ugh, as bad as finding bugs and they are trying to sell us something? No wonder we prefer traveling in our Motorhome. Not resort quality, Holiday Inn needs serious consideration of their quality control. And this is our first night! We were awakened the next morning by the thump, thump, thumping back and forth of the footsteps from the tenants up stairs indicating cheap wood construction of the units. BTW- if a company is offering a promo to get you to ""buy in"" they have to treat you as a valued customer; put bottled water in the fridge, a welcome note and a little basket of crackers, cheese, wine, SOMETHING! Not impressed at all.",1,0
Holiday Inn Club Vacations Scottsdale Resort,"Resorts, Venues & Event Spaces, Vacation Rentals, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","A nightmare come true. Was offered a three night stay at a Holiday Inn Express if I sat through a two hour time share presentation. I was planning a trip to Phoenix and travel a fair amount, so I decided to check it out. The salesperson was relatively nice at first, though she asked quite a few questions that seemed inappropriate and overly personal. I am a single, financially comfortable female of a certain age, and yes, I am dating someone, but I do not require his participation or permission to make decisions. By the end of the two hours it was clear to me that the club was not a good fit for me. That's when things took a turn. 'Susi', my sales person turned even more personal and inappropriate, suggesting that there was something wrong with me for turning down such a great deal, said that she knew I was a waste of her time the moment we met, and proceeded to insult my relationship partner for not agreeing to sit through the program with me and also hinted that there was something wrong with me for being with him in the first place. I was so shocked at her attitude and behavior that I couldn't even respond to her insults. She then said that even though I clearly wasn't going to buy in, that it hadn't been two hours yet so I was going to be sitting there for a while. All in all it was a most unpleasant experience and it's hard to believe that the company trains or allows their employees to behave in such a manner. At this point I'm not sure I will ever stay at a Holiday Inn of any type again. Stayed December 2016",1,0
Holiday Inn Club Vacations Scottsdale Resort,"Resorts, Venues & Event Spaces, Vacation Rentals, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","The WORST experience!!!!! My boyfriend and I were invited to stay at this resort for a complimentary weekend as part of a timeshare presentation. We were told we had to attend a 2 hour presentation on a scheduled day that weekend. Cool. We arrived on a friday, and our scheduled presentation was on saturday morning. We were actually kind of excited because we had never even heard of this kind of time share. Our sales representative, Beth, started off great. We were genuinely interested in what she was selling. My boyfriend and I love to travel, and we had never even thought of doing something like this. The problem is that she could not answer any of the questions we had about the way the timeshare worked LOL. She literally could not answer a single thing we were asking... She kept saying she needed to get to the end of the presentation to give us more info, and she was starting to be extremely rude. My boyfriend owns a company in New York and had received 2 or 3 business calls during the presentation, for which he politely excused himself and did not take longer than a minute to return. This lady had the audacity to ask him to put his phone away! LOL sorry, i didn't realize we were back in grade school. On top of that, after making us sit through a ***3 and a half hour*** presentation, she finally presented us with the numbers. LOLOLOL!!! These people are batsh*t crazy asking us to pay 16gs for what is equivalent to a one week stay once a year in one of their resorts, which are all in the US btw. Now I understand why she didn't want to give us numbers up front. we would have laughed in her face and walked out. Oh and I should also mention that you do not have a day or two to think about it, as you would with any big purchase you ever make in your life. They want you to buy it right there and then so that you don't have time to get home and think about what a HUGE ripoff this entire thing is. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Seriously, you're better off paying for a stay at any hotel than having to sit through this miserable joke.",1,0
Holiday Inn Club Vacations Scottsdale Resort,"Resorts, Venues & Event Spaces, Vacation Rentals, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","My fiancé and I, unfortunately, had the worst experience here. We selected this hotel for ourselves and our guests for our wedding weekend. We booked a 1 bedroom suite in October 2015 and checked in the morning of our wedding on 2/14/16. At no point during that 4 month period did the hotel ever tell us that there was construction going on at the hotel. We pulled up to see half of the rooms blocked off by unsightly constructions barricades. We checked into our room and walked across the property to our casita. On our way over there, we walked past another unsightly area, an outdoor storage for all of the furniture/construction items, that was right by the pool. Great atmosphere, right? So we get to our casita and notice that it is right next to another casita that is blocked off by construction barricades. We did not think much of it because the front desk staff did not say anything and the next day was a holiday, President's Day, so we figured there would not be construction. After dropping our stuff off in the room, we had the time of our lives at our wedding and arrived back at the hotel around midnight and finally got to sleep around 1am after having a very long but exciting day. Fast forward to the next morning and we are both woken up at 8am by extremely loud construction that was happening directly behind our heads in the room that backed up to ours. We tried covering our heads with pillows but it was no use, we were awake. The drilling and hammering continued and we had to leave our room because of the noise and lack of peace. We were never told in the months leading up to our reservation or by the front desk staff that there would be active construction during our stay. We visited with family that day and stayed one more night at the hotel. Again, the next morning, the construction crews were there bright and early to wake us up. I went to the front desk to check out and told the staff about our experience and how I was upset that this is how we got to spend the day after our wedding. I was not offered any concessions by the staff but my info was written down and I was told a manager would give me a call that day. Well, it has now been over a week since we checked out and I have not heard anything from anyone at the resort. I am extremely upset that we spent as much as we did (this place was not cheap) to be woken up at 8am on a holiday, the day after our wedding. There are tons of resorts in the area and I will never stay here again or recommend this hotel to anyone. They just took our money and didn't care to follow up with us about our poor experience.",1,0

Holiday Inn Express Peoria North - Glendale,"Venues & Event Spaces, Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel",We stayed here for a baseball tournament this week and had to check out early because the first of 3 rooms we had a broken toilet seat and shower was spraying water all over the bathroom. So I complained to the front desk and they moved us to another room. As soon as I walked in the room with my wife and daughter I looked down and saw a huge cockroach on the floor next to the bed.. so I get the manger show him and he moves us to a 3rd room..The 3rd room was not much better it was dirty and smelled. So we decided to check out early from our stay and go to another hotel.. You would think that the manger would try to make our stay more pleasant and accommodate us but he did so in no way.. On another note our other friends were staying there and I paid for one of her nights with my credit card and they still charged her card for that night.. even with the receipt in hand showing paid for... I will never stay there again or recommend it to anyone. Also they should have the live in handy man in uniform and not hanging out in the lobby with the guest.. STAY AWAY from this place.,1,0

However I have never felt so uncomfortable than here. They looked at us like it was an inconvenience to be there and using my rewards. Both checking in and checking out. No customer service at all the room felt like it was unfinished and there was still trash on the entertainment center. There was loud banging noises early in the morning. I don't think I will ever stay here again even if its business related.

Very comfortable beds and amazing pillows and towels. That's where the good stops. The woman at the desk was rude and disrespectful when i checked in. When asked if there where any smoking rooms she rolled her eyes and said i could smoke outside... And then while sitting down to a breakfast of burnt bacon and dry eggs the MANAGER asks one of the construction workers if he had any Mexican friends that pushed chicletts. THE MANAGER Jeff. I have never been so offended in my entire life. A man like this should never be allowed to work in the hospitality industry. At this time i would not recommend this place to anyone. Think twice before coming here. On an amazing note... The gentleman that works over night was super cool and very helpful. He went out of his way to make sure that my stay was half way decent.,2,0

I'm still trying to figure it out but I think he didn't work there and I'm almost positive he wasn't a customer because he stepped aside when I walked up.

Holiday Inn Express Peoria North - Glendale,"Venues & Event Spaces, Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Jeffrey trill general manager holiday inn express peoria On Thursday, October 29th, 2015 I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Peoria, AZ. I was in town, along with the rest of our family, to attend a funeral. We arrived around 6:30pm only to drop off our bags and head to the Wake. When i went back later that evening to my room, ready to shower, exhausted from the long drive i noticed long black hairs on the walls of the shower & the drain. I was so disgusted. There was no question that it was mine since i have red hair. (I took pictures as well). It was only myself and my brother in the room. It is now late in the evening & checkout is in the morning & we attend the funeral. Since the phone in my room wasnt working, I went to the front desk & the employee said she can leave a note for the manager in the morning. At 7am i speak w the General Manager, Jeffrey Trill, and he speaks so fast as though he was being accused of something & i said i would either like a free night for that evening or a future date & he immediately started talking defensively & 100 mph. His exact response was ""my hands are tied since you booked your room through Expedia. I cannot do anything for u except offer you a late check out at 2:30pm"" That was my ONLY option. To stay in a dirty room, longer. I was in town for a funeral, not a vacation. My mind is mourning & i had to deal with this type of customer service. Apparently, since i went through Expedia i was not treated like a valued customer and it didnt matter to him that our entire family booked about 12 other rooms in the same hotel. i called Expedia customer care & they spoke with Jeffrey Trill, the General Manager & suddenly his hands weren't tied like he said. Now he only offered to refund $24.48. Again, my ONLY option i am given. I went down stairs to speak with him and asked how he justified a dirty room with $24.48? And again he started talking super fast and defensively & told me i went through Expedia, a 3rd party, and his voice intensified louder. Only then at that point did i realize i am in a small town and if i have to get this resolved i have to go higher up. I then contacted Corporate a few days later. Where they agreed that he didnt even offer 1/3 of a refund & he handled the situation incorrectly & offered further alternatives. Thank you to corporate my issue was resolved. If anyone ever has to deal with this manager in the future, it is best to contact Corporate while still in the hotel. That is what they recommended to do. No customer should be treated this way. i will continue to stay at Holiday Inn hotels, this is a rare case, but this is a dirty hotel. Response: thank you Jeffrey for the way you worded your response to my very detailed review, and only showing the public first hand how you deal with customers! Thanks for proving my point. Have a great day!",1,0

However, this places stinks! It's dirty. When we walked in, we immediately noticed smudges on the mirrors and a dire need for a fresh paint of coat on just about everything. The sheets had a weird smell, but I'm sure they were clean, albeit poorly. The tub barely drained; I had to keep turning it off before continuing my shower because I was standing in a pool of water. Personally, that grosses me out, but that could be just me. It is also worth mentioning that I take quick showers... The people are nice and the blueberry muffins at the breakfast buffet are really good.

Holiday Inn Hotel Montreal-Midtown,"Hotels, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","Like another Yelper said below, TripAdvisor had some happy travelers who stayed here, but many Yelpers were very unhappy here. I didn't think it was so bad- 3.5 stars. Yes, you'll find hairs on your pillow/bed linens (not huge clumps of them or anything, but a strand here and there due to static electricity) and bathroom floor, but I have only found my own hair; I think the maids only do a thorough job of cleaning if you check out, to get it ready for a fresh check-in. When I checked in, I didn't find any stranger's hairs. if you're staying multiple nights, you will find your own hair in places, because the maids are like, whatever, it's your own hair, it won't kill you! And seriously, static electricity is a strong opponent...It's not the maid's fault that the pillow fabric is prone to it. The front desk was nice, and very accommodating. Just dial 0 on the hotel phone if you have any questions. The front desk people I dealt with genuinely cared about making my stay a comfortable and happy one. But they assumed I wanted a smoking room, which is a weird assumption to make, and when it was clear I didn't want smoking, they looked for a non-smoking and provided me with non-smoking...I stayed with one other person, and they provided 2 double-beds without me having to ask for separate beds, which was nice. Also, a lot of people on Trip Advisor said this hotel was too old....Yes, they had full-flush toilets, and yes the doors had old (but well-kept) room number plates, but really, are they REALLY reasons to hate? My room looked exactly like one of the pictures in this Yelp album. It was spacious, clean and everything worked (except one of the plugs, but hey, that's why I'm giving 3.5 stars...) It's located midway between McGill station and Place des Arts station. If you want to spend most of your time in the Plateau and Old Montreal area, get a hotel that's located more north of this hotel...But if you're gonna venture to the south side of Montreal as well as the north, this hotel has a great location. True to another Yelper's review, any sound in the hallway really carries to your room. I didn't understand why some university students, despite having their own rooms and despite the strong wifi, had to come out to the hallway to do all their gossiping and assignment work... All in all 3.5 stars. No huge complaints, but yes, it's not a 4-star stay.",3,0

I was with a small group so the staff asks that a solo traveler behind us step through and get handled. His room wasn't ready... 15 minutes later, it was our turn. After another 15 minutes, we're told our rooms aren't ready and that we should have a seat. After another hour or so, without anyone from the staff fully explaining the issue, offering us any sort of compensation or apology, our rooms are ready. But only three of the four. This is now two hours after check-in. Yes, Holiday Inn, I wanted to spend my first few hours of vacation on your couch. So we head up to the rooms. Smoking floor. None of us smoke. We're assured that's what we booked and at it doesn't really smell. Inside the rooms... Where to start? Worn out rugs, musty smelling linens, lumpy beds, a commercial grade toilet (think: gas station), and more... The shower was reminiscent of summer camp as a child. The temperature varied about every five seconds from absolutely scalding to ice cold. I spent the first ten minutes of each shower trying to get comfortable before retiring to the fact that the knob didn't do anything and this was going to be a terrible shower. We were told by the front desk ""if someone in a room near you is showering at the same time, you may experience temperature variations."" No, really; they said that. The only thing this shower had over the camp shower that I recall is you didn't get electrocuted when you touched the nozzle, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case in some rooms. And the AC... I realize Montreal is pretty far to the north and air conditioning isn't a top priority, but in a hotel it needs to at least be a thought. In the middle of a July day, the room was pretty much unbearable. At night, despite it being in the 50s outside, it was a no-covers sweatfest. Luckily, we had our own beds, but if you were trying to sleep with a significant other (or insignificant other... It is Montreal, after all), you'd have a terrible time. It was so bad that we called the maintenance guy. He somehow justified the lack of air flow and coolness on the fact that ""they keep me in a room that is about 90 degrees Fahrenheit."" The staff has completely invalid explanations for everything. Bravo, management. Noise insulation was non-existent. From inside your room you could hear every conversation occurring in the halls as well as those in the rooms surrounding you. Not good for sleeping or telling secrets. I was here with a group; I have knowledge of about six rooms. They were all more or less the same. Of note, a green cloud (marijuana) could be seen when you exit the elevator on a smoking floor in the wee hours of the evening. They were right... Didn't smell like smoke at all!

Lo, even as I speak, Hey Ya is breaking out. The DJ is singing along over the microphone. It is 11PM. Two of the four plugs in this room do not work. With three people staying in the room, you can see how this becomes a problem quickly. The wifi is free but spotty. The AC appears to be controllable via voodoo magic and prayers. It is quite toasty in here in mid-May; I shudder to think of what it must be like in actual summer. The pool is nice at least, as is the lobby. Nice gift shop. Walking distance from a lot of shops and restaurants. It's a good choice if you're only planning on using it purely to crash in after you come in from the clubs really late at night/early in the morning.

First off, the Holiday inns in the states are pretty crappy. When I walked into this one, I was a bit amazed that the quality here was so much better in Canada. The prices were decent, the rooms were nice, and the staff were great. We were able to get a discount because we got a price match, which made it even better. The location is pretty central to everything, which made everything within walking distance, I guess that in itself is where a great deal of the value lies. Lots of hot women working here, which is always a plus. My room was missing a few of the key items that normally gets supplied, such as hand soap and cups, but it wasn't that big of a deal for me, as they were able to give us an adjoining room with my other friends and I just used theirs. One of the employees who were dropping off our invoice was a dick though, warning us: ""that type of smoke"" will set off the alarms and the fire department will come down and charge us $200. I don't know what smoke he was referring to, as we got moved to a smoking room (they ran out of non-smoking rooms) and I just recently smoked a cigar. I thought it was rude, especially since it was 3am and he knocked on the door. I think he just assumed we were smoking something illegal.",4,1

Bathroom was bad: mold between tile, gaps between tile, between floor and wall. Bathroom door had brown stain all over it. Entrance tile hasn't been cleaned for who know how long. I don't want to mention tall mirror by the closet. When I complained to the front desk, they told me all rooms are in the same condition and they can not find a better room for me. To make things worse, there is no soundproofing at all. I've been woken up by babies crying, people drying their hair or simply talking next door. Amenities are not worth mentioning. They do change Wi-fi password whenever they feel like it, had same password for two days, then changed twice in one day.... Location is ok.

An enormous high school hockey tournament had taken over the hotel. Every elevator was packed with screaming kids. One time, we got an elevator, but there was projectile vomit on the door. We stayed for two nights. The first night included sounds of kids running up and down the hall in front of our room, laughing, shouting and kicking doors until 4am. The reason our experience gets 2 stars: The management reimbursed us for the first night after we brought up our inability to sleep. No change the next night though. The restaurants in the lobby are overpriced and uninviting. Since it's walking distance from downtown, it's good for a bargain, I guess. By no means stress-free.",2,0
Holiday Inn Hotel Montreal-Midtown,"Hotels, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","Imagine my chagrin when I pulled up and the lobby was sea of college students on spring break. It was impossible to get an elevator because the hoards of dimwits apparently did not notice me standing there with my luggage as they shoved their way past me as the doors opened. When I was finally able to get an elevator that was at maximum capacity I got joy of listening to a non-stop floury of F-bombs. My comfortable lounge that I have enjoyed so many visits before was invaded by a bunch of armature drinkers trying to get extra drunk before they hit the town. People were throwing up in the bathroom and it was not even 9pm. The real fun started around 1am when drunks started to return to their rooms. From 1am to about 4:30 I laid in bed listening to doors slamming, yelling in the hallways (more f-bombs) and fighting in the streets below. At 7am I wanted to get breakfast but the restaurant was filled with the last of the returning booze hounds. While there were tables available I decided walk to Tim Hortons. I want to like this hotel, I just don't like the kind of customers it attracts. The trick to staying at this hotel is to get as drunk as everyone else.",2,0
Holiday Inn Hotel Montreal-Midtown,"Hotels, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","I recently stayed there again on my trip and it was much better this time around!!! The room's temp. was much more bearable and I got to see my two favorite bartenders that work there (sadly, only for one night though:( ). Can't wait to go back and stay there!!!",5,1
Holiday Inn Hotel Montreal-Midtown,"Hotels, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","In case you suffer from TL;DR, this sums it up: ""No word of a lie, the soundproofing is so non-existent, my husband heard one of the cretins in the room next door let out a ripping fart."" For more, read on.... I broke my ""never book on Hotwire for more than 1 night"" rule and ended up at this hotel. And I got burned. I suppose for the price, we got what we paid for. But I should've paid more and gone elsewhere. First, the Okay bits: -Our room was clean and everything worked. Things were certainly old and worn, but serviceable. Our basic needs were met. -Mostly staff were pretty responsive. When we arrived, our coffee maker didn't have a pot, and one was brought up quickly. We asked for a fridge in our room partway through our stay and received one within an hour. -The porters were helpful and friendly when it was time to head for home, storing our luggage while we grabbed a last lunch in town and getting us into a cab quickly and efficiently. -The WiFi (on the 6th floor) was free and reliable. And now, the not-okay parts that dragged this hotel down into the crapper: HOLY GOD THIS PLACE IS SO NOISY! It appears that every room is adjoining, and joined only by single doors (rather than the more common double-doors I've seen). Those single doors are ill-fit to their frames and have large gaps top and bottom. Result? It sounds like the person in the adjoining room is actually inside your room. No word of a lie, the soundproofing is so non-existent, my husband heard one of the cretins in the room next door let out a ripping fart. Speaking of the cretins next door, this is very obviously a party hotel. The hallway floor was stained with bleach where staff had attempted to clean vomit out of it. Thursday through Saturday nights, the hallways and rooms are full of drunken 18-25 year-olds yelling at each other and talking shit. And as drunkards of any age are wont to do, (when they weren't barfing in the hall that is), using the toilets, a lot. Which wouldn't be a problem if the toilets weren't noisy enough to wake the dead. Even in our own room, we had to adopt an overnight rule of ""if it's yellow, let it mellow"" or we'd wake each other and our kid up every time we went. On top of that, the front-desk staff were useless. We asked where we could find a store selling diapers, and were told ""uh... I think there's a gas station about 8 blocks away."" We asked about a place to get a bottle of wine on a Sunday and were also told ""Oh, it's Sunday, the liquor store next door is closed, they all are."" Acceptable answers, until you realize there is a Provigo grocery store less than 2 blocks away selling all of the aforementioned, every day of the week from 8am-midnight. If you're looking for a cheap hotel where the norm for guests seems to be acting like a noisy, destructive arse, this is your best bet. If you'd like those who seek out such hotels to die in a fire? Stay far, far away.",2,0
Holiday Inn Hotel Montreal-Midtown,"Hotels, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","I was already thrown off by a 3.5 star rating on a Holiday Inn but know some of their international locations are quite nice so reserved initial judgement until I arrived. A lot of attitude from the staff when being quite even mannered trying to find out things like what time room service ended and how to get on the wifi. The wifi was horribly unreliable on the 15th floor. The room was DIRTY and WORN and OUTDATED -- shelf in closet falling apart, old beer can behind the television, spilled coffee on the wall, stains on bed, very few power outlets (including none within reach of the coffee pot, I had to move it into the bathroom to use), very outdated bathroom and decor. I also did not enjoy that the windows were not able to open at all. Size was fine, sheets/mattress were comfortable. Location is perfect. I've read in other reviews that they are in the middle of a renovation but my room on the 15th floor (needed key access so I thought would be nicer as an executive level, NOT!) wasn't lucky enough to make the transition yet. We also had to listen to the loud ice machine (which was broken) and vending machines on floor, even though we were a few doors down from it.

Holiday Inn Hotel Montreal-Midtown,"Hotels, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","I stayed here with a group, so I'm sure our selection of hotels was hugely affected by the cost per room, but for a place carrying the Holiday Inn name, I had much higher expectations. To echo another review, the construction in the lobby and ACE bar/restaurant lead you to believe it's new modern, etc, but when you get to the room you realized it is not. The room is untouched from it's previous incarnation in contrast to the nouveau lobby. I was supposed to have 2 beds, alas I had a king sized bed and luckily the couch was a pull out. Both were equally lumpy. I needed bedding for the pull out, so I called housekeeping and they brought it to me - I answered the door and the guy said ""oh let me put your bed together"" - and then proceeded to drop a stack of sheets and blankets in a pile and then walk out of the room! I was in shock! The fridge/mini bar was inexistent. The pipe room was next to us and kept me up all night with it's squeals. We had to get maintenance to come and get the A/C to work. You can hear anything happening inside the bathroom in the room... ANYTHING. Which leads me to the shower... if I wanted to hear a banshee wail, I would watch a movie or find a clip online - I don't need that horrendous, high pitched squeal as I'm showering!

Holiday Inn Hotel Montreal-Midtown,"Hotels, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","Okay, this place was just horrid. I stayed here twice. Once on the casual traveler's floor and once up on the executive floor. Both times I was much less than thrilled. So let's look at my 4 important features of a good hotel, clean, good bed, location, and breakfast. First let's talk about clean. I was willing to forgive the construction in the lobby, but the chipped doors, rusty mini-fridge door, and old Subway napkins on the desk was just too much! And then I went and dropped a my cellphone on the floor by the bed and YIKES it was nasty between the bed and end table. Second the bed. It was lumpy and sagging in the middle. This was in the remodeled rooms! I did not sleep well at this hotel during either of my stays. Location was okay. It wasn't near the office I was working at, but it was only a short walk to the underground and then a good 10 minutes walking under the city to where I needed to be. The access to the underground was a life saver when I was there in February. Breakfast was non-existent. I went up to the executive level and there was no breakfast goodies what-so-ever and the restaurant in the hotel was overpriced, had poor service, and was not all that great. All in all it was a miserable experience. To their credit they tried to make things right, but it just wasn't going to happen. Try Le Crystal or the Hilton Bonaventure instead.",1,0

Their complimentary breakfast should be modeled by all hotels, oh man what a selection they offer every morning and for a great period of time as well. This is great because you can gauge when all the business people go, so you can wait them out before taking your family there. Outdoor pool, indoor gym with just enough equipment for a quick workout.

Its not an elegant type of place. However, it is definitively everything else that you would want to experience excluding the ""fancy"" extras. The rooms are spacious with comfortable furniture and beds. They have extra pillows and blankets in the closet. Both of the rooms we got had full kitchens with modern and clean appliances. The staff in the reception area are very polite and accommodating. One day when it was clearly after the breakfast hours, one of my kids asked if they were still serving breakfast. The lady said in a friendly and polite voice: ""no, we are not, but what would you like?"" Oh, wow!... That is customer service. We wanted extra pillows and blankets. Housekeeping told us to look in the closet for extras. Nevertheless they came to our door with extra linens, pillows and a smile. We requested a late check-out to allow our kids to go swimming. They didn't give us any trouble. The pool and Jacuzzi do not have a life-guard on duty. However, they have plenty of comfortable chairs for adults to sit and relax. The hotel keeps extra pool towels for guests as well. The price of our room included breakfast. Breakfast was a set-up that allowed guests to make their own waffles & eggs. They had all the toppings needed as well as fruit. They had cereals, milk, coffee and various juices. The tables were clean. The parking outside was plenty. Well lite at night.

Homewood Suites Pittsburgh-Southpointe,"Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","So in town from Kentucky for buisness for the next 4 weeks. Brought my husband and 2 kids since my project assignment is so long this time. I arrived early to learn the area over the weekend. I checked in Friday afternoon and was immediately greeted by a NASTY front desk clerk (nasty in the sense of rude, unfriendly, snotty ect.) She immediately acted as if we were a hassle letting me know the room I booked was not the room I was in. We KINDLY accepted her decision to tell us we did not book the right room AND THAT WAS OUR FAULT SHE WASNT CHANGING IT, we decided to deal with the smaller less equipped room. After we finished the unfriendly check in process went to our room where we were PUNCHED IN THE FACE with a horrible air freshener smell that was more than nauseating!! My son with asthma immediately began hacking and coughing but nevertheless we brought our things in the room front desk clerk told me they just ""spritzed"" more than needed and there was nothing they could do. The furnishings were nice the space was adequate but there was no stove and with expedia listing it as a full kitchen this felt like a big inconvenience but we summed that up to a miscommunication with expedia. The ceilings are covered in cobwebs, water leakage stains cover the walls, lamps, and ceiling and the bath tub shower combo looks like something out of a low income housing project not a Hilton NO SHOWER CURTAIN PROVIDED AND IT TOOK 45 MINUTES TO GET ONE WHICH WE HAD TO INSTALL OURSELVES. The bed was hard, cheap springy and not at all what we would have expected. The sofa bed was HORRIBLE!! HONESTLY my 11 year old will sleep on a cement rock without a complaint but he was truly sad about the hard uncomfortable smelly (he said it smelled like feet) mattress. We requested a pack and play but were told they would let us know LATER if they had one (FYI when it arrived it was from the 1970's and one side didn't latch so it was not usable). So finally after seeing all of this we went to the front desk and very calmly tried speaking with the two front desk clerks just to see if maybe we were in a bad roon. They were so rude the female spoke to me as if I was stupid she treated us like dirt and quickly pushed us away for the next guest who was requesting directions to a local restaurant and then the man immediately laughed at us for asking about an oven (residence inn, towneplace suites all include one so didn't know that was a crazy question). The housekeeping tried to accuse me of stealing the shower curtain saying he knew he put one in he was loud and AGGRESSIVE and made me very nervous to call and ask for anything again!!!!! Since we already checked in, paid, and brought our things in we are dealing with this until Sunday evening but I not only don't recommend this Hilton hotel but after the horrible customer service I won't stay at a Hilton again! With a travelling auditor and travelling nurse as your guests losing their frequent business is not a smart move! Look I know the other reviews are great but either these people were fake, they had different rooms and complete different staff, or we were discriminated against for being in bum clothes with sleep hair from a long drive!!

My king suite was comfortable and the hotel's common areas were in good shape - pool and hot tub, outdoor fire pit, and a dining area where guests can get a complementary hot breakfast. What makes this a five-star review for me, though, is the staff. After getting back home I realized I'd left my electric razor in the bathroom cabinet. I called and spoke with AJ who had the cleaning crew find it for me, then shipped it over-night so I had it the very next day.

Both of the rooms I stayed in were like mini apartments with a bedroom, living room, kitchen and bathroom with two flatscreens. The service here was always helpful whether it be the front desk or the staff helping with the food. The gym was reasonably equipped for both a cardio or lifting workout (which is more than other hotels I've visited). My ONLY complaint about this place is the complimentary dinner and breakfast. All the hot foods that were served looked like they all came out of the freezer and then mass cooked in a microwave. Don't get me wrong I do like microwaved food at times :) but a lot of the food just was not tasty. On the bright side, my rooms had a kitchen with a fridge and a stove, so one quick trip to the supermarket solved that issue. Other than the food, this place is grrrrrr-eat!",4,1
Homewood Suites Pittsburgh-Southpointe,"Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","The hotel itself is clean, quiet and friendly. The biggest complaint is I booked the room through the Hilton website at least 3 months in advance and upon arriving found out our 2 bedroom suite was not available and the hotel admitted to overbooking. We were pushed to a 1 bedroom suite for 5 people. We originally reserved it for for 4 nights. That is a long time for a large group of people. Very disappointed especially since it was not our fault.",3,0

One of the nices aces to stay in or around Washington PA! Free light meals for breakfast and dinner too!",5,1
Homewood Suites Pittsburgh-Southpointe,"Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","Yep. A full five stars...however, allow me to be precise. This is a five star rating on a *three* star hotel. Meaning: It is as good as it gets...in this category. What you get: An immaculate suite room with nice HD flatscreen TVs in both the bedroom and living area; along with a nice kitchenette and Ikea-style hotel-grade furniture, all for a very reasonable price. Plus, there is free parking, free Internet access and cable TV...including HBO. I particularly like the fact that they don't have the TVs ""locked down"" so you can hook up an external device if you so choose. Just plug your media player of choice into the available ports in back, then use the ""function"" button at the bottom of the supplied remote to choose the correct input. If you don't travel with a Roku or similar device as I do, they also have a DVD player included for you. The gym is great for a small-town business hotel, comparable to a ""Reebok Gym"" at your local Westin. It is good sized, clean, and comes with a selection of Precor treadmills and cross trainers. I made good use of these as well as the freeweights...but never made it to the indoor pool, but that looks nice enough. ***However*** unless you like your food well processed, your coffee watered down and your fruit ripened in the back of a freighter...steer clear of the free meals. Instead, ask the front desk for menus to the local restaurants that deliver. They have a sushi place, Chinese and pizza that come well recommended. Only being here for 2 nights, I ordered in once, opting for ""Hunan Inn"". Decent Americanized Chinee Foo...but I digress. All in all, I very much enjoyed my stay here such as it was. Being more of a big-city-guy, I can't say I'd like to be in Canonsburg long term, but if you have to be here, you can't go wrong with the Homewood Suites. Likely the best place in town.",5,1

Hotel 1333,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","We searched this hotel online and booked it through hotels.com.The hotel had good ratings online so we thought this is the best available option next to the airport and they had a free shuttle service anywhere within 5 miles of the Hotel vicinity. Keeping in mind about their free shuttle service we thought to drop off our rented vehicle a night before we had our flight .After dropping off our rented vehicle we took a shuttle to the airport and called the hotel to send in their shuttle to pick us up around 8.00pm.We were waiting for about 30 mins for the shuttle called the hotel to check if we had accidentally missed their shuttle but they said hang in there the driver is on his way.Waiting for about 30 more mins the shuttle finally reaches the airport and as soon as it reached he complained of a flat tire, Well that was situational but the point here to make is waiting for an hour for a distance of less than 10 mins was ridiculous.There was no apologises from the staff as if they didn't really care about customer service. Hot water is definitely available in the bathroom but you need to leave the tap open for at least 15 mins to get decently warm water.The hotel is under construction and no cleanliness is maintained.The lifts are dirty and so is the carpet. If you feel you are getting a good deal for the money you pay you are highly mistaken.We had a 7 day trip in Arizona but this was the worst decision we made.Think twice before you make a decision to stay in this hotel you will be disappointed.",1,0

I purchased a groupon here as I have done with other hotels, came to check in, and the front desk lady told me I wasn't in the system to check in that night. I showed her my groupon, ID, AND credit card to show her evidence that I purchased a room. Finally she decided to check the hotel emails to show that I was right all along. All across the hotel lingered this putrid smell and the breakfast? Shouldn't even be considered breakfast if it's tiny bagels, stale bread pastries, and coffee. My advice go to a hotel with enough good reviews before booking and that will accommodate their guests well.",1,0
Hotel 1333,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","The staff is very friendly for the amount of complaints I'm sure they get. The hotel lobby is beautiful, but I the real fun started when we got up to our room. Within the first hour we were in our room, it started to smell overwhelmingly like sewage. It got to a point we needed to change rooms, which was fine because they were nice enough to have someone take our luggage to the new room for us, since we had to be somewhere right away. When we got back to the hotel that night after an excusing day of driving four hours, plus 6 hours of work, I decided to take a shower but could not close the door, which is not a door so much as a sliding wall. We called the front desk, yet again, to take care of the problem but they informed us that maintenance had gone home for the night. So I took a shower with the door open. Early the next morning my roommate had to do the same thing, except had more of a surprise than I did the night before. I haven't spent a lot of time in Tempe, but the cockroach that flew at her in the shower was the biggest I have ever seen. I trapped it under a cup and, for the last time, called maintenance to come take care of the issue. The maintenance man came to fix the door, but had no idea about the roach. He stepped on the cup, successfully killing the big, but left the smeared guts in the bathtub. We never saw maintenance again after that. My roommate left with bed bug bits all along her legs, and I left thanking God I only have long legged pajama pants. The front desk management is so fantastic, I can't believe this hotel is so horrible.",1,0
Hotel 1333,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Skip this one. They are in a strange limbo between changing management so everything is bare bones and minimal effort. It seems like they are trying to keep up the appearance of being a trendy hotel but fall very short. Perhaps in a year or so, their redesign will be complete, but until then, not great. Spent the majority of the time trying to solve the puzzle box that is the temperature control in the shower, rather than enjoying a shower. I am not one to pass up free food, so that should speak volumes to the fact that I skipped the sad continental breakfast. The only redeeming quality to my stay was Jon the bartender who served me a great *strong* prickly pear margarita which was on special that day. Thanks Jon!!",1,0
Hotel 1333,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","The bathtub was disgusting and looked like it hadn't been cleaned. The shower curtain did not hold back water so after one shower the floor was soaked. Our balcony faces a wall. The sliding door to the bathroom leaves a crack so that anyone can see through the crack and see a bather or someone using the toilet. There is a huge stain on the ceiling of our room. The continental breakfast consisted of bagels, danishes, fruit and coffee. After leaving for a few hours the room now smells of musty, musky and moldy. The heater leaves a burning smell after a short time of use.",1,0

First of all, the man checking us in was extremely rude to me and didn't take the time to check if he gave us the right room (he did not).

In our room it smelled like mold and dust, and the carpet looked like it hasn't been cleaned in years (dust and dirt and tracks!). Every time I came back to the hotel, the elevator got more and more disgusting. There were handprints and marks from spilled drinks. The front desk workers never said hello, and didn't pay attention at all when we entered/exited. I didn't feel welcome or comfortable in this hotel.

The beds are extremely uncomfortable and there was no air vent in my room which made it very stuffy. There were tissues and crumbs on the ground when I arrived at the hotel.

Hotel Elegant,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","The customer service and management of this motel is horrendous. My husband and I stayed there last year for the 4th time (previous three times were pleasant enough, but there was different staff working there - a young woman) and were greeted by the font desk worker who said ""why would you want to vacation in Montreal, why not go somewhere warm"" - ummm ok, way to promote your city? Our key card reader did not work on our door because the battery was dead, they did not have another room but put us temporarily in a room that had not been cleaned yet, it was kind of awkward. After the worker finally tracked down the owner he was able to finally manually get the door open with an actual key. The locksmith was not able to come out an repair it until later the next day apparently so if my husband or I needed to leave the room one person needed to remain. My husband went down to get us breakfast (the breakfast sucks there) the next morning while I stayed in the room, we ate in the room, but eventually we were ready to start our day and head out. I asked the front desk (a different worker there when we checked in the night before) how we can get in and out of our room throughout the day/after we return from our Montreal excursions they gave us a key, we tested it ad it worked. OK that's fine right? I get a call on my cell phone that afternoon/early evening saying they need the key they gave me to unlock someone else's room since the same thing happened to their key card reader, I let them know I was on my way back anyways and will be there soon. After I hung up I realized how confusing and weird that was: 1. they don't have another key to open this person door and 2. probably the most alarming thing, they gave us the master key When I got back to the hotel (it was the same front desk person that checked us in, a bitter little unhappy man living in a small unhappy world) I expressed my concern that the hotel gave us the master key, I don't feel safe with my items in the room, do they do that often, what if they give the key to someone else and they get into my room (my computer was in there) - he proceeded to flip out and tell me it was not the master key, and that he's going to kick us out and not refund our money and he doesn't care if we ever come back and it's not his problem. I told him fine I'm going to get my stuff and getting out of here since he was literally screaming at us and I was scared about what he'd do next. He followed us upstairs where I called his bluff and said if this isn't the master key than it won't work when I try it in the neighboring door, when I went to try it he grabbed my hand and the key ad kept screaming at me, he opened our room shoved us inside and said get your stuff and leave or stay I don't care. Needless to say we left, but not before calling the police (who couldn't do anything about it). I was appalled that someone in customer service would treat a customer like that, swearing, yelling, and getting physical with them. The hotel itself isn't anything great, and is certainly not worth the low cost. After all that we were charged for 2 nights but only stayed 1 (we were slated to stay for 5 nights). Luckily we got some of our money back, ad the hotel manager was ""nice enough"" to offer us a free night next time we stay, hahaha don't waste your time, or money - there are plenty of other reasonably priced places in Montreal.",1,0

Hotel Indigo Toronto Airport,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces","Hummmm... Quite different from ones in U.S. Much cheaper and less luxurious. You get what you pay for . Price: $178.53 in total. King size with breakfast and 5000points. Breakfast :I thought breakfast is buffet according to their web site pictures but it is not. You can choose from menu. $8.99-10.99 worth. Toasts and bacon and eggs are cooked well. Muffin is flesh and warm. Indigo breakfast $8.99 is good enough. British breakfast is small for the price $10.99. Staff: They are helpful and nice. Room: Clean and simple. Not so many things. Shampoo, conditioner, 2 soaps, makeup remover, 2 coffee, 2 black tea. No bathtub. No hair dryer! Microwave and fridge and safe. Airport view. Really quiet in spite of many passing by airplanes. Location: Close to airport. 5-10 minutes drive. They have a complimentary shuttle service. It's not convinced to go to downtown. Gym: Tiny but has weights, water cooler, sanitizer, ... Good enough. Swimming pool: Indoor and big enough. Jacuzzi is out of order now. It has dry and wet saunas. If I have a chance to stay here again, I'll go for the basic plan without breakfast and extra points around $100. P.S. This shower room doesn't have a door like The Empire hotel in NY. It cost about $700 for only 1 night stay. I was shocked by it and the awful view. Their roof top bar is cool though. This Indigo has much better view with tons of airplanes:)",3,0
Hotel Indigo Toronto Airport,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces","Totally sufficient for a day/overnight stay. I had a 10 hour layover (yikes) into CPH (Copenhagen) here and got a great day rate until 6pm, more than enough time. I just wanted to nap, do work, shower and head back to the airport and total experience was fine. Shuttle back to the airport not an issue, service not an issue. It's a typical Hotel Indigo and for the rate and responsiveness of staff, Am fine with it. Visits: 1 Tip: This is a good if not great alternative to sitting at the airport for 10 hours if you want a bed and real shower. Always ask for the quietest room when you stay by any airport, they have those. This hotel is a few miles from the airport. I got a quiet room and slept great!!!

I chose the Indigo and am glad I did, Several calls in advance of my arrival were handled very well. Bravo Amanda and Stacy. I am disabled and was able to get their one and only disabled accesible room. The room was a decent size with wood laminate flooring (LOVE IT!). The bed was perfect firmness for me, and the pillows were perfect for me as well. The wall mounted flat screen TV was in an odd position and should be on a swivel mount. Free Internet was of good speed. Did not eat the next moring, but while waiting for the shuttle, I looked at the menu and spoke to the waitress. Prices were very reasonable for a hotel, and the waitress said the reviews she hears have been good. She said lunch was awesome, but I have no firsthand knowledge. My only negative was the shuttle bus. The entry step is too high off the ground. I am 6'1, and a partial amputee. I had to have the driver pull over to the nearby curb for additional height and even then I had difficulty. They have no disabled access on the shuttle unlike the Holiday Inn. The hotel is located on the east side of the airport next to a flight path, but the room was quiet. Nearby is a Greek place and a Hooters. A moore's clothing store is next door, and I scored on Clearance items. Of the 3 hotels, I would choose this one in a heartbeat. It is listed on hotwire as a Boutique Hotel which I would agree.",4,1

The waitstaff was frindly but apologized after each meal forthe eexperience. Sunday, with 2 hours left of the brunch they were almost literally out of food, drinks and silverware.

Hotel Indigo Toronto Airport,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces","Indigo Hotel describes itself as a boutique hotel, which typically suggests uniquely styled rooms, luxury furnishings, stylish appointments, and certain amenities like wi-fi and a lounge. Described by Priceline as a 3-star hotel, its room rates have a typical upcharge for the exclusivity, $119/night, compared to cheaper rates for other hotels in its class. I scored a deal for $48/night off Priceline's ""name your own price,"" and I would not pay full rack rate. Check-in was easy and painless, and I was assigned a room on the second floor. I was too tired from the drive in to think to ask for a room facing away from the road and the runway. I had no idea how close the airport runway was to the building -- another good reason to check Yelp in advance. Unless you find the roar of jet engines at all hours of the night soothing, you may find yourself sitting bolt upright in bed hearing a noisy roar that rattles the windows. Walls are also quite thin. I heard a baby crying and someone's television at odd hours. The room itself was modern and attractive, with wavy wood floors throughout and a super-large king-sized bed. The desk is pressed up against the wall with a comfy white leatheresque padded chair, and a pair of overstuffed chairs face the TV on the wall. Watching TV from the bed wasn't very comfortable despite a mobile arm. The bathroom is large and bright, although the shower is equipped with only a glass half-wall. I worried about getting the tile floor all wet from a basic hair washing, and was glad I put down an extra towel. Make sure to check in before parking your car. Hotel Indigo locks the top floor access to the hotel to room keys, and I trudged over four floors in -11'C chill. There is no elevator service and the stairwells are badly marked. Dragging heavy luggage will not be fun but fortunately I had light carry-on. Parking costs $10/night, not a welcome addition atop the room charge. I suspect several people use park and fly services. Parking is very tight, be careful. The beau and I ate in the restaurant downstairs, which serves breakfast and dinner. We both went for the Phi burger, which came out medium rare, dripping grease, and stomach-flopping with a pile of mushrooms and cheese that just didn't taste right. I got through about four bites and gave up. Definitely not my cup of tea. The restaurant/bar is attractive enough and open until 11PM for food, 12PM for drinks. Hotel Indigo feels like a more upscale alternative to a Quality Inn, but not truly a boutique hotel. Shop around for savings.",2,0
Hotel Indigo Toronto Airport,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces","I only used it for parking since I was going away for a week and the price was right. I won't go back. The shuttle doesn't drop you off by your car when you return, and if you're parked at the top you have to take the elevator to the second floor, go down the hallway past all the rooms, exit to a stairwell, drag your luggage up 2 sets of stairs, at which point you go outside and roll your luggage down to your car without any light. I got back to the hotel around 1 in the morning and couldn't see my car, which was parked at the top level. I had to use the remote to see the lights on the car flash and then roll my luggage down the lot to the car in complete darkness. It's completely unsafe. As a pedestrian, you're walking in the dark where cars are also driving and as a safety concern, you're completely alone up there. Next time I'll be using a real lot and will be happy to pay the extra money since the lots are very well lit and you're dropped off close to or right at your car.",1,0

Over all, nothing special in my opinion...it would be a great place at 60-70 bucks but at over 100 it offers very little value for what they are asking in my opinion. Parking is extra too.",2,0

HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","*flea alert Ever since being a student attending the university several years ago, I had always wanted to stay at Hotel Red. It seemed chic, clean, and I had heard the rooms were great. As an alumna, I was excited to return to campus and book my stay at Hotel Red, especially since we could bring our 6 year old black lab. However, I left very disappointed by the end of my stay. The room was beautiful and spacious. The people seemed friendly enough, albeit not very accommodating when I asked for simple things like band aids. The sheets very terribly itchy. And during the entire length of my stay, they didn't change the bedding or make the bed or pick up anything around the room. We were running out of towels and I was getting nervous about the cleanness of the hotel. Here's the kicker: WE LEFT ON SUNDAY WITH FLEAS. Our dog has fleas everywhere and I had multiple bites. In our years of owning pets this has never happened before. I know our room was a pet friendly room, and you run a certain risk there, but i thought they would have at least thought to WASH THE COMFORTER AND BEDDING before the next guest stayed in order to avoid situations like this. Guess not. Needless to say I'm a little bit disgusted, a lot bit angry and a whole lot sad that this hotel isn't one I can be proud of as an alumna of this beautiful campus.",2,0

HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Easily one of my favorite hotels anywhere. Let's start with the building and the rooms: a quick glance should tell you how you're going to feel about it, as the whole modern and minimalist feel with concrete everywhere isn't for everyone. But if you are into that, it's fantastic. The rooms look and feel like you should be paying a lot more a night. While the style is what drew me for my first stay, the people were the reason I knew I had to come back. Quite literally everyone I interacted with was wonderful. Whether it was the manager, the front desk staff, the bartenders, shuttle drivers, or housekeeping, every single one of them was pleasant, easy to talk to, and made me feel at home very quickly. Since it's a smaller hotel, staff is pretty minimal, which for me is a perk - you'll recognize everyone after a day or two. Better yet, they'll know you. My first stay was a few weeks ago, and this time around I was immediately recognized at the airport, people remembered my name and conversations we had, the manager introduced himself, etc. Honestly, I cannot say enough good things about the staff and how incredibly welcoming they all are. The only ""complaint"" I have is that it's a bit far from downtown, just shy of two miles on foot. But if the weather is nice, it's a pleasant walk. They also offer the perk of free bicycle rentals through the city bike share program, so between that and the shuttle it's easy to make your way to the capital. Also on the topic of the shuttle - they do provide complimentary to and from to Epic if that's what you're here for, and on your last day they'll bring your bags and get you from Epic and get you to the airport. If you like high-end modern design and nice people, you can't go wrong.",5,1

Definitely not your typical hotel room, more like staying in a cool concrete loft like you would see in downtown Chicago or New York. Full kitchen with impressive minibar full of snacks and drinks, large sectional sofa, beautiful lighting and decor, and a large furnished patio. Very modern, artistic furnishings, but still cozy and comfortable. Beautiful bathroom with a large shower and Aveda products. I travel to Madison for business fairly regularly, and this is by far the most chic hotel I have found here. I also had dinner in the restaurant. Service was very friendly and attentive. Wine list was unique. Craft cocktail list was a bit disappointing compared to other restaurants of the same caliber here in Madison. I tried several small plates, and they were all tasty. They offer a very reasonable happy hour selection of appetizers and drinks. There is also a nice outdoor patio for the restaurant. I am looking forward to staying here again, especially when the weather is nice and I can take full advantage of the patios of my room and the restaurant!",5,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","We stayed Saturday-Monday. A little bit off the beaten path because we wanted to be around state street, but the excellent staff provided us with free shuttle to and from wherever we went. Our room was amazing. Hotel is clean and was pretty quiet.. Compared to our room Bathroom shower is out of world & the bathtub in the master bedroom was a real treat. THE BALCONY THO that was the SPOT!!!",5,1

HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel",Don't stay here if you have a dog because there's absolutely no place to take him to the bathroom The rooms also give you no privacy and if one person wakes up earlier to take a shower the light shine through in the room and they hear everything because there is a hole in the wall towards the ceiling which is part of the modern design but it absolutely is illogical,2,0
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","I haven't stayed the night at HotelRED, but I have been for a bridal shower and a meeting and have enjoyed both trips. The hotel is pretty sleek and modern with easy access to the stadium for game day and Monroe Street for shopping and dining. The little lounge area next to the Wise restaurant in the lobby was comfortable and a great place for a quick business meeting. Parking is available on site, though the turn-in for their driveway is sort of an alley and I missed it the first time I visited and had to drive around the block a couple times before I realized the lot was obscured by the building itself. For the bridal shower I attended we were in a suite and it was pretty lovely. There was a lot of space for us to mingle and chat and eat. The room setups are unique - in one of the bedrooms the toilet was on a platform that you then slid doors shut around. It was kind of bonkers, but memorable. The RED has a shuttle service that will happily deposit you downtown, and they picked us up at the end of the night as well. Definitely a super useful perk with so many of us. Other things of note are that the front desk staff have been nothing but helpful and friendly in my encounters, and if you have a pup with you they're going to be treated well - there's a dog bowl and welcome sign in the lobby for visiting dogs. So cute!",4,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Had decided to meet friends for a drink and light supper.The first problem at Hotel Red/The Wise is parking: almost impossible. I have heard that one can park behind the building, but signage suggests that only guests of the hotel can park there and I didn't want to take a chance of getting towed. Parked on the street and took my life in my hands getting across the Monroe/Regent crazy intersection at rush hour. Yikes. Don't try that drunk. The staff at The Wise was cheerful to a fault, but they didn't seem to have a clue what was going on. There was confusion about the menu, but finally a long list of substitutions appeared -- ha ha, ""just off the press (it literally was still warm). Our server tried to explain it but even she was confused. Easily a third of the small plates were not available. We finally settled on one of them and also ordered a large-plate: the Fondue, which sounded like a great thing to share among the 3 of us. Perfect, right? It would have been, but... it ""wasn't available."" Huh?? If we hadn't already ordered and gotten our drinks, I would have walked at that point. To their credit, they did bring us a complimentary small plate assortment of meat/cheese roll-ups, which were delicious. Overall the vibe was ""not prepared to receive guests."" I'll have to be strongly persuaded to go back. A final note: This building is hands-down the ugliest structure in Madison - which already has the UW Humanities Building high on that list. Hotel Red has nothing to do with the architecture of the neighborhood around it and looks as though it's not finished.",1,0
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","A nice step away from the usual chain hotels. This place has style. The bathroom is a highlight. Good location near the university, a bike path, and some good shops, Trader Joe's, and restaurants. Coupon to use the city bike rental program for a day. I'd do it again next time in Madison.",4,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","We visited the bar after a badger football game. It was PACKED! We could barely move. They had several bar tenders behind the bar but most of them seemed ill equipped to deal with the extreme number of customers. They overpoured, and some were flat out rude. I actually watched a bartender tell another guest that she was, ""not very happy with them"" and ""I'm done with you after this"" when he requested another drink. While I fully understand that they were busy, I felt this was extremely unprofessional. When we finally got someone to get us drinks it took him approximately 4 minutes to pour two glasses of wine! He was clearly untrained and had no idea what he was doing. He struggled to open the wine bottle. We also ordered a bloody mary, as they looked amazing. Mine was served with a dead bug on the celery, a real dead bug, not a halloween decoaration. Disgusted but not wanting to wait for a new drink, I just removed the celery from my glass. Upon drinking it, it was really strong and also tasted like the juice was rotten. I took another sip and then tossed it. While I'm sure that hotel itself is lovely, they really do need to focus on their bar. I will not be back.",1,0
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Stayed here with my significant other this past weekend, very nice hotel, everyone in the lobby/bar were very friendly. Loved the room, the robes, the shower was nice but the door doesn't do much, water ended up all over the floor afterwards...and the bathroom isn't fully enclosed so when you turn the light on, it shines out to the rest of the room, which isn't too bad, unless it's late at night and you don't want to disturb anyone sleeping in the room.",4,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","My wife and I celebrated our 10 year anniversary here. We wanted a relaxing break, and Red delivered. Our suite was huge with a view of Camp Randall stadium, and the complimentary shuttle service dropped us off in Madison to enjoy the night life. We would highly recommend Red because of the friendly staff and modern layout.",5,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","HotelRED is in a really nice location - close to coffee shops, shopping, and some eats. And the rooms are quite lovely. They are spacious enough to include a kitchenette and the minibar is one of the most impressive I've seen in a hotel. It's definitely a modern design with almost everything feeling new, from the giant king-sized bed to the showerhead and sprayers in the bathroom. I was worried upon entering when I saw that the floor was basically concrete, without carpet, about how cold it might be, but my fears were for nothing because even in the dead of Madison winter the room was toasty warm. Due to a flight cancellation I was only able to stay one night in the hotel, but the staff were so kind and accommodating that they accepted my late cancellation without a charge due to the inclement weather. Free coffee in the lobby in the a.m. until 9 ish and a restaurant onsite all add up to a pretty nice hotel package. If you are looking for a hotel in this part of Madison you can't go wrong with HotelRED.",4,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Rarely do I feel compelled to write reviews, but our experience here this past weekend was just awesome. The atmosphere was excellent all-around, with free parking, wifi, valet, and a shuttle service to anywhere in town. We got chocolates when we arrived, and our room was clean and felt super posh. Every employee we met was extremely helpful, warm, and friendly, especially Molly at the front desk! She drove the shuttle to the place we had picked out for lunch (The Old Fashioned! Awesome!), and was really excited to talk food with us. I'm an intense researcher when it comes to food when I travel, so I had a list of spots picked out before we came. She let us know which were worth stopping for, and recommended some spots I didn't know about. We took her advice and went to Bradbury's for coffee after lunch, and it was delicious. She really helped make our trip special, and we will definitely be staying at this hotel next time we come to Madison.",5,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Love the location to Camp Randall. In fact, I love the outdoor patio. If you are not looking to be in the middle of a crowd, avoid this place on game days. The Wise is a pretty good restaurant, nothing outstanding. However, the place has a good feel. Essentially you go there for the location because they are prime Camp Randall space. I wish I had more to contribute but I have not stayed here. I have only been to a gathering in the space off the lobby and restaurant. And I have been to the restaurant. It is a clean looking, modern lobby. I would definitely host a function there.",4,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Great hotel, and if you're in Madison for a Badgers game (Go Bucky!), the location can't be beat (it's right across from Camp Randall). Small, modern, boutique hotel, with nice amenities and an incredibly wonderful staff. We were given an early check-in and late check-out without any problem. For starters, they offer free parking AND free wi-fi, so right off the bat, I'd be inclined to stay here over most other places in the area. They also offer a free shuttle service to anywhere within a three-mile radius. That certainly comes in handy as there can be some difficulty in parking in Madison. We used the shuttle to go to the Farmers' Market and it worked out perfectly. The hotel is pet-friendly, and there's a bowl of treats and a ""welcome"" sign with your pet's name on it in the lobby. I thought that was super cute. I imagine on a busy day, the sign would say ""Welcome Sparky, Lucy, Hunter, Fluffy, Charlie, etc."" The room itself was wonderful. There's a small kitchenette with a two-burner range, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator and REAL dishes, silverware and glassware. They even had champagne glasses so we could enjoy our Veuve Clicquot properly. The honor bar features locally made products and liquors.(I so wanted to scoop up the adorable mini bottles of Death's Door gin and vodka, but at $11 apiece, I decided against it.) The bathroom had a separate toilet area, which is always appreciated, especially when you're not traveling solo. The European Spa shower was pretty amazing too, once I figured it out. There were so many handles and levers, that at first I thought I was in an airport hangar and not a shower. The rooms have concrete walls and floors so the floor can get chilly, but they offer complimentary slippers to all guests. There's a small fitness center on the premises and complimentary grocery pick up from a local store. Be sure and check out ""The Wise,"" the hotel's restaurant and bar for some tasty vittles and cocktails. There's even an outside patio that I can't wait to check out in the summer. The only negatives I have would be that for a hotel that prides itself on being ""green,"" it was dismaying to see the dishwasher running when we checked into our room, but with no dishes at all inside. And despite hanging our towels up after use so they wouldn't be replaced (as instructed), we still were given new towels. I also didn't like the fact they only had Coffee-Mate creamer and not ""real"" cream--we're in Wisconsin! If you're going for an upscale feel and have Keurig brewers in each room, then methinks you should not have imitation dairy products. I realize I'm probably splitting hairs, but I just can't stomach non-dairy creamer in my morning joe. I loved this hotel and it's definitely going to be our first choice when staying in Madison. Of course, I may feel differently staying here during a Badgers home game, because I imagine it's an entirely disparate experience. 4.5 stars.",4,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Fantastic experience in the end! We started our trip with a bad experience at Hotel Red but they more than turned it around and made us happier after having had a problem than they could have if we had never had a problem in the first place! The food was great, location fantastic, rooms and lobby well designed. No complaints!",5,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Hotel Red is top notch! I stayed with the hotel for 4 nights so I was searching for a hotel with affordable rates, a good location and high quality. Hotel Red exceeded my expectations! I was upgraded to a suite that overlooked the UW Football Stadium. I was within walking distance of restaurants and entertainment, but found the hotel restaurant offered a delicious menu. Very Very Clean, Classic Modern, and the Coffee, soaps and linens are by far the best offered in Madison. You can't get this quality downtown. You will love your stay at Hotel Red! Also, their staff is very accommodating. Heather was great to work with!",5,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Stayed at HotelRed for 3 days and our stay was wonderful! The rooms were gorgeous, and every single employees were very friendly, and was willing to help with any problems we encouters. (i.e. our shower had really hot waters only, and when i called, someone came up within like 5minutes to fix the issues) We stayed in the room with bathtub in the room, and it was heaven! the kitchenette came handy, and i can't think of a better place to stay in Madison, WI! :)",5,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Color me (red) impressed! HotelRed is pretty fab! In terms of accessible and affordable hotels (outside of game days), this modern abode is tops. Let's roll down the attributes, shall we? The location: A stone's throw away from Camp Randall and very accessible to campus. If you need to throw yourself into anything Bucky related, this is a great location. The lobby: Clean, modern and full of red accents! I felt quite welcomed in this well lit space filed with friendly employees. The service: Speaking of friendly, everyone I encountered from the front desk attendant to housekeeping to the concierge to the CM was quite cool. Not overly smiley-in-your-face-so-cheery-it-hurts, but perfectly amiable. The rooms: Full kitchenettes in every room! Woot! And a nicely price honor bar to boot. The beds are quite soft and comfy with a nice view of the large LG flatscreen. The bathrooms are also very modern with a giant showerhead and sprayers. And don't forget the Aveda bath products. Don't think I didn't take those home. My one recommendation - provide each room with a pair or two of slippers or grippy socks - those concrete floors can be chilly on bare feet! The restaurant: I ordered room service from The Wise, the restaurant downstairs. My baked mac and cheese with artichokes and pancetta was pretty delightful. If you get a chance to snack or sip at the hotel, definitely give the restaurant a go. Plus, their patio is comfortable and huge! The amenities: Free parking, access to a few nearby fitness opportunities (health clubs, bike rentals, running trails), and complimentary chocolates and beverage upon arrival.",5,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","My family and I loved this place. Sure the staff are college kids and probably don't know as much as they could have about families with kids and what to recommend, but they were very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is very modern, which I love. I've never stayed in a hotel without carpet (they've got concrete floors in the rooms with rugs), but honestly ... carpet is pretty gross, hides all sorts of dirt. So I appreciated the concrete floors, which were very clean (and I appreciate the fact that you could tell if they're dirty). We had a king size bed (we thought it was a bit too soft) and a pull out couch bed for our 2 boys. I believe it was a suite. It had a balcony, a small fridge, a sink, microwave, dishes and flatware... plus wine glasses and a wine opener. The location is really good .... great pizza place (Pizza Brutta) walking distance down the road. We've stayed at the Ruby Marie before last year, and we liked it pretty well. But we'll be back to HotelRed without a doubt!",4,1
HotelRED,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","No questions, this was the best hotel experience, EVER. We stayed in a single bed room, which also had a sofa sleeper, and had more than enough room for the two of us. The urban, metro, and euro design were well incorporated, and the multiple jet body shower was to die for. With the kitchenette this felt more like a rented loft and less like a hotel. The staff were impeccable and tended to our every need, including resolving an issue with another room on the floor whose guests were smoking weed in the room/building. The cordial staff went above and beyond to make our stay memorable, and they did just that. The recommendations for restaurants were great and the complimentary shuttle made getting to and from downtown Madison a breeze. My only suggestion to the management would be to have the custodial services staff follow the ""green"" procedures of not replacing towels which were hung to dry. A minor request which in no way significantly marred our experience. An overwhelming thank you to all of the staff who made our six night stay memorable. There will be no need for us to find a different hotel the next time we are Madison, HotelRed will be our destination of choice!",5,1

If you coming to Madison this is the place to stay.",5,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","First, a warning: the hold they put on at the beginning of the stay includes an extra $100 per day as an allowance for potential room service. We were there a week and didn't know this ahead of time so it was a bit of shock when we got there and the hold was $700 more than we had expected. That said, the hotel is amazing. The front desk clerks are very knowlegeable and happy to help out. The rooms are spacious. The tub and shower are top-notch. The chairs are that modernist style with the light padding and good fit. Very comfy. With only about seven rooms per floor, there was not much noise around us. It was fun to watch Quebec TV, which is a mix between French-speaking local channels, some English programs dubbed in French, and some national stuff like CBC and TSN. I did try the room service once and the food was pretty good. There is one of those little fridges stocked with items that cost something like 4 or 5 dollars if you take them. It's great for convenience, but there is a Couche-Tard right around the corner. We went and stocked up on munchies there. Forget about parking around here. It's on a pair of narrow streets right downtown and the spots will certainly all be taken when you get here. The hotel is two blocks from the nearest entrance to the Square Victoria subway stop, and then there's a block or two more walking underground to get to the actual trains. I highly recommend taking the subway everywhere. There is a bus route nearby, but the busses have to sit in the congestion and construction. Things I would change about the room are pretty minor. The main one is that there aren't enough outlets near the bed. I was able to plug in my CPAP, but our phones and battery pack all had to charge way on the other side of the room. And that's a long way because these rooms are big. Also there wasn't a good way to force the AC or fan to run, and even though the thermostat said 65 degrees, it never felt like it was below 70. An ice cold room is really nice after a day of touristing and a walk from a sweaty train station.",5,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Gorgeous hotel in the heart of Montreal. The hotel is sleek, modern, yet very comfortable. My room was spacious with a large working office area, big stand alone tub, cozy robes, slippers, lots of outlets, welcome cookies in my room and a nice view of gorgeous Montreal. The room was spotless and well put together. The staff were accommodating and very pleasant. I love a great hotel gym. This is not where you will find one. Two pieces of equipment and super tiny. Probably best to walk all over the city. I just wish I had more time here. Great spot.",5,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","This was one of the most enjoyable hotel stays, and it really came down to the service. Yes, the hotel room was lovely and the location was perfect for exploring old Montreal, but it was really the small touches that made Hotel Gault stand out. From the moment we pulled up, confused about parking, the staff seemed genuinely interested in making us feel welcome. After a 5+ hour drive, the immediate offer of tea was particularly thoughtful. I was especially touched that the bartender, Ahmed, for asking if we'd ever been to Montreal and, upon realizing we had not, immediately pulled out a map and directed us to the key points of interest. The room itself was beautifully decorated with a simple design, but it was the soft classical music and fresh cookies that made the great first impression. After dinner, we stopped for some drinks and Ahmed expertly led us not only through the cocktail menu- which he designed- but also through some of the uncommon spirits in his bar (how do they get the pear in the bottle??? Come here and find out!) I have really never felt so well-cared for (in an unobtrusive way) at any hotel. I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Montreal.",5,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","We loved staying here... I cannot say enough good things about the service! They could not be more accommodating! Normally we are not high maintenance guests, but this trip was different. We were packing in a lot of fun in a short time... When we checked in, they had already upgraded us. Lovely. (Thank you!) We had a number of special requests: - would they store our Easter Basket so our son won't see it - would they decorate our room for someone's birthday and have a dessert with candles (as a surprise) - would they make us brunch with the bagels we picked up at Fairmont bagels Of course there were normal things like: room service, dinner reservations, directions, etc. All done with enthusiasm and a desire to help. One night we had friends over to the hotel... We hung out in the back lobby by the fireplace. So cozy; like being in your living room. Our brunch: One morning we Ubered to Fairmont Bagels, ordered, and then Ubered back. Fairmont is a small bagel shop, only take cash, and they don't make sandwiches. When we returned to The Gault, we gave them our bagels, and they made us a lovely spread... Salmon, capers, pickled onions, cucumbers, choice cream cheese, freshly squeezed oj, cappuccino, homemade jams, traditional eggs... So fantastic and something for everyone. Ps. The Gault had the same bagels. So u don't have to take the uber rides unless u want the full experience. (Lol) Service is so spectacular!!! My son didn't miss having a hotel with a pool for a minute. In addition, the hotel is perfectly located to get to most things easily by either walking or a short uber ride.",5,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I loved Hotel Gault. Everything about it makes you feel like a celebrity taking a quiet weekend away. The staff is extremely accommodating and warm and the building is beautiful. We opted for a ""corner loft"" room and it was stunning; it was like staying in an apartment that you'd see in an interior design magazine. There were lots of special touches, too: classical music was playing when we entered the room; there were bathrobes and slippers; the shower products were lovely; and the bed (memory foam?) was so comfortable. Coffee in the lobby in the morning is convenient, inexpensive, and damn good. I would definitely stay here the next time I'm in Montreal.",5,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","You know how some places are almost perfect Hotel Gault is an almost perfect. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They made our dinner reservations and suggested a great bar for us to go to nearby. The bar and restaurant suggestion was excellent. They brought up fresh baked cookies after check in. The downside is just my opinion. They are currently located in the middle of quite a bit of construction. They can't help that, but it does make it harder to get there by car. It is easy walking distance to Old Town Montreal and the room was very quiet.",4,1

Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","We have stayed at many of the other modern Old Montreal boutique hotels on business trips, but loved the Gault for having more natural light and space compared to the others. Old Montreal is our favorite spot to stay when we are in the city; it's classic and hip at the same time, and full of great spots for dining and exploring. Our JR suite room at Hotel Gault had gorgeous, classic exposed brick. The staff were all exceptionally friendly - no French attitude here! We didn't love the color of the birch wood closet and desk, but it all worked together okay in our room. The rest of the design was on point. The free but super slow wifi would have been a huge issue if we had to work during our stay, but luckily we were there over a holiday weekend. Valet parking ($35/night) was available and prompt, which made it easy to deal with our car even though you're in the old city.",5,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Our three-day stay in Montreal was really good because of the Hotel Gault. There are almost too many good things to list!

Very friendly, and he will make you a great drink! A couple of (very small) potential cons to consider: it can get a little loud at night if you're facing the street, and the bathroom in our room was an open layout bathroom -- for a couple like us, it's not an issue, but I could see it being a problem if you're traveling with a friend.",5,1

We were upgraded to a king suite and were very grateful. The concierge took time to explain the main roads, where our restaurant reservation was, where our car rental location was and how to get out of the city once we leave Montreal. The room looked like an ultra cool New York loft. The bed linens were so clean and crisp and the bed was extremely comfortable!! The bathroom was so chic!

That being said, I found this place on a spur of the moment trip for my girlfriend and I on travel advisor and trusted the reviews on that site. Plus the location and pictures gave me a good feeling. We arrived in the evening in -5 degree weather after a stressful, icy weather 6 hour drive and pulled over across the street. Suddenly, we were sweetly greeted AT OUR CAR by a staff member who then valet parked our jeep and brought in our bags. He was like a French-Canadian angel! :) It only got better from there. Staff was warm and friendly and their service had an effortless quality. I have stayed at boutique and higher end hotels in Western Europe, Canada and America and nothing else has compared.

Yes, the Gault is well known for its award winning design, and may be unique in so many ways - I can't recall - to Montreal. BUT, aside from the architectural details and a comfortable bed, and the modern and brilliantly designed bathroom, the stand out feature of my stay was Andres, a concierge. He made my stay warm and inviting. Without him, it would likely have been just another brick and mortar experience with pleasant faces behind a desk. When I think of where to stay in Montreal, I only think of the Gault solely because of Andres. He did a phenomenal job making my friend and me feel welcome. Thank you very much, Andres!",5,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","This is the place to stay in Montreal. There are many other ""boutique"" hotels in Old Montreal. But, these made-to-look-like boutique hotels just don't compare to the historical, architectural, and minimal gem that is Hotel Gault. Their very affordable nightly room rate is of great value, considering how nicely designed this small hotel is. Minimalist guest rooms are appointed with European designer furnishings, such as Artemide bedside lamps. Cabinetry was custom made for this property. Ingo Maurer lighting is found in the lobby. Design details matter here. Lastly, from a hospitality angle, Hotel Gault has an extremely helpful concierge team, and they always make sure our stay in Montréal is the best possible (they know the restaurant scene inside and out, and will easily get you into the best restaurants possible, sometimes, with little or no notice).",5,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","We had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Gault this past weekend. The hotel itself is beautiful and meticulously clean in a great location (close enough to everything while still being quiet). We were lucky enough to receive a complimentary upgrade to an apartment room which greatly exceeded our expectations-- while minimalist in decoration, the room was both cozy and luxurious. The staff was also outstanding, offering friendly greetings and opening doors for us each time we passed through the lobby. Our rooms were promptly cleaned each morning, and the turn down service (with surprise champagne and treats the first night, as well as water bottles) was a treat after a long day of exploring the city. We were also pleasantly surprised to find that the valet had left cold water bottles in the car for our trip home! Overall, I can't rave enough about this hotel which made for the most perfect, relaxing long weekend in Montreal. Hope to return soon!",5,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","In Montreal for a long weekend of exploring the city on foot and eating our way through the simple to the sublime.

Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","The Gault is a wonderful destination. My fiance and I stayed for Valentine's day weekend 2012. We picked what could have been one of the coldest weekends all winter to visit Montreal, but due to the cozy warmth of our home-away-from-home at the Gault we felt so comfortable! The room was lovely, we had a loft basic package and really enjoyed the heated floor and cute door overlooking the street. The bed is super soft and really a nice complement to the modern look of the room. There's turn down service and cookies provided daily. The location of the hotel in Old Montreal could not have been better - it's perfect for walking through the area and very close to the waterfront. We took part in the spa package offered through the website with the Scandinavian baths and really enjoyed the experience. Our massages were great and the price was reasonable and cheaper than what we would have paid on our own. I emailed the concierge ahead of time to request a special wine and snack celebratory surprise for my fiance and they were so helpful. The entire request was provided to perfection and right on time. I would highly recommend working with the concierge as the recommendations for dinner and jazz club were completely on-point. I've given 4 stars instead of 5 for a couple of reasons: the price is still a bit high for what you get, the breakfast is not included in the room rate although we were told it would be upon check in, and the gym is adequate but quite small.",4,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Loved Hotel Gault! the location was great, walkable to incredible restaurants, etc., the staff was amazingly sweet/knowledgeable/helpful/friendly. the room was urban-hipster-chic, the bed super comfy, linens/sheets were high quality, flat-screen TV, iPod docking & big windows added to the ""boutique"" feel. Once you shut your door, it was very quiet - no noisy neighbors/etc., & we were right across from the elevator. I should mention, you best be tight with your travel companion b/c the loft-like set-up means there is virtually NO privacy while you're showering (glass shower is basically IN the room with a very sheer curtain separating the sleeping area. it didn't bother me, but i could see how some may not like being ""on-display"" & may appreciate a bit more privacy -- depending on who you're with ;-)",5,1

Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Hotel Gault is by far the best boutique hotel I've ever stayed in. The service there was unbeatable. The moment I walked into the hotel, the staff already knew my name and that I had requested an early check in and late check out. They offered me a complimentary drink in their lobby bar/restaurant while they went upstairs to check the hotel room. The room itself was beautiful with high ceilings. Free wi-fi and cute location in old Montreal. I'd come back next time I go to Montreal.",5,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Hotel Gault has a great location in Old Montreal (a five minute walk to the Square - Victoria Metro station). The building is elegant on the outside and contemporary/hip on the inside. The lobby is quite stark with a concrete floor and modern furniture. This contrasts with the warm and effusive staff members who are the antithesis of aloof hipsterness. They are full of local tips and genuinely show hospitality. The rooms are contemporary/hip, as well. This means concrete flooring with some short carpet and a flooring that looks like a modern woven plastic placemat, modern furniture, a futon style bed, and no cabinetry (wheeled shelving units). It can be a bit too clever: poor lighting, bathroom ergonomics that are troublesome, and a generally messy look. Housekeeping keeps the room clean, but is a bit lax on some details like glassware and tidying the place up. Breakfast is served in the lobby. Included in our room rate was a continental breakfast. Even though the place was generally empty, the service was excruciating slow, given that no cooking was required. We would have complained were it not for the delightful servers who always displayed a bit of quirky Franglish humor. The breakfast, itself was just fine. The room rates are pretty high, Montreal is not an inexpensive city. Stay there if you are looking for a design-oriented place and are willing to overlook some inconveniences. The staff will charm you.",4,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I stayed here a little while back for a three day visit to Montreal and it stands out as the best hotel experience I've ever had. The staff were accommodating, helpful, and went well above and beyond. Not only did they make last minute reservations, offer (excellent) restaurant recommendations, and help us navigate the metro... When we told them that we were on a hunt for amazing and unusual bottled beer to bring back to Ontario, they got busy on the internet trying to find the best place in town for us to search. The location is great, in the heart of old Montreal (and my room had two big floor to ceiling windows that I could open and gaze out). The building is lovely, our room was immaculate, comfortable, clean, and creatively decorated, which is such a nice treat in a ritzy hotel. I adored every minute of my stay here.",5,1
Hôtel Gault,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","THE STAFF: Friendly and able to suggest restaurants in the area. Helpful also with giving directions and obtaining a taxi for you. THE ROOM: Spacious. Stylish. Comfortable. THE BED: Huge. Comfortable. Nice sheets. THE BATHROOM: Gigantic tub. Separate shower. HEATED FLOORS which I never thought mattered but now I know they are heavenly. THE PRICE: Good value for your money. They also seem to have deals if you call them up. THE FOOD: I had lovely crepes and eggs benedict w/ smoked salmon for breakfast. It was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. THE LOCATION: It is quite close to the subway and as mentioned the staff will help you with directions. Old montreal is a nice looking place, and it's a short / cheap cab ride to other parts of montreal if you don't want to take the subway. (Though you should, because it's easy and fast.) I would never stay anywhere else.",5,1
Hôtel de Paris,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","The stay wasn't really that bad. I did have problems with housekeeping. They 2nd day they cleaned the room but didn't leave any clean towels, we folded the towels and sat them in the chair but according to the front desk you need to just throw them on the floor. And in order to get the towels we had to walk across the street and get them ourselves, they don't bring you anything. The 3rd day our room just didn't get cleaned. The 4th day our room got cleaned but no toilet tissue or floor towel. When asked could we get our sheets changed instead of saying of sure, housekeeping asked how long had we been here. In the morning the foot traffic in the hallway from housekeeping will definitely wake u up at 855am each morning after being out all night. The front desk guy was really nice when we checked in and came to get the sheets so this wasn't the worst place and it wasn't the best place. May come back due to the great location, may not come back because I need a clean room to stay in without all the issues",3,0
Hôtel de Paris,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","This place is awesome! We were lucky to have a parking place in their small lot. Mattheu was fabulous at the front desk. He offered friendly service as well as great suggestions for our first night there! The breakfast croissants (plain and chocolate) and entire staff were wonderful! The hotel was funky and in a great neighborhood! We were able to walk to where the Walk of the Giants were parading on the opening weekend of Montreal's 375th Anniversary. I can't say enough about the wonderful experience we had. Our room was small, but it was perfectly suited to our needs. Very clean, hot water, good pressure!! Highly recommend for a down-to-earth experience.",5,1
Hôtel de Paris,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services",Had a reservation that was wrongly booked and instead of apologizing I had 4 employees gang up on me and explain to me how I was wrong. Have never experienced worst customer service in my life and would pay double to avoid this place.,1,0
Hôtel de Paris,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Really, really wanted to like this place for it quirks, but there were so, so many flaws in our stay that I have to warn other's away. First, free parking is simply a lie. There are a few street spots available directly next to the hotel, but they still have enforcement times that require moving in the middle of the day during anything more than a few day stay. This was a major headache after driving all day to reach Montreal and finding out that there was no place to park within an easy walk of the hotel. Second, the room (in the Annex across the street) was a mix of broken screens, inoperable windows because of broken hardware, beat up paint, etc... (This for one of their premium rooms I might add.) Couple this with room service that seems to only make the bed (but not change towels, provide additional bath products daily, etc.) that generally seems to ignore the rest of the room issues. Third, The lobby area of the annex was filthy, the carpet looks like it had never been cleaned and was worn to threadbare in many spots and too make this even worse there was trash, ignored dead flowerpots, and general filth on every bit of the annex grounds/yard making what should have been a lovely building look completely neglected. The highlight here though was a broken plastic laundry basket that sat outside of the annex's front door for the length of our stay. Last, the bathroom appears to be a recent renovation by someone who must have actually never used a bathroom before. There were no surfaces (counters, shelves, etc.) to actually set things on, no hooks for cloths, no racks in the shower to place anything you'd commonly use. Couple this with a shower that is basically too small to actually do much more than step into and which seems designed to pour water out of the stall onto the main bathroom floor which meant we were stuck using (our unrenewed) towels to mop up gallons of water every day. Montreal is lovely. Find probably almost any hotel, B&B, hostel, etc. and go, but for your sake do not stay here.",1,0
Hôtel de Paris,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","The staff was pleasant, but our room was the worst place I've ever stayed. The building - an annex, across the road - is old and none of the walls or floor were insulated, meaning that every noise our neighbours made sounded like it was coming from right next to us. And that noise was frequent and loud! At 11pm we went to buy earplugs, which were the only way either of us slept at all that night. Even then we both woke up several times throughout the night due to sounds from beside, above and out in the hallway. Our room was also right beside the patio for the hostel, and the windows were just as insulated as the walls (see: not). To top things off we discovered in the morning that the headpiece of the bed was simply resting at the top of it, not attached to anything. An aesthetic point yes, but really? Next time I'll pony up and stay somewhere that isn't made out of sheets of paper!",1,0
Hôtel de Paris,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services",Hey I just want to know where they get their coffee from. The hotel stay was nice because I'm all for customer service but really I'm just here for to grab some info on that coffee from downstairs. That is all,5,1
Hôtel de Paris,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","2.5 stars, really. I wanted an inexpensive place to stay while visiting Montreal, and wasn't expecting anything spectacular when I booked a ""budget"" room at Hotel de Paris for $100 a night. The room was adequate; tiny but clean and quiet. Check-in was fast and easy, staff were nice and able to change my American money for Canadian, and I was able to park my car for free in their driveway. The location was good; plenty of cafes, bars, restaurants and shops within a mile radius so I didn't need to use my car very much. However, a few complaints prevented this from being a 3 or 4 star experience. First, the mattress. It badly needed to be thrown out; we could feel and hear the springs every time we moved on the bed. The walls needed to be sanded and painted. And even though this was a budget hotel, I've stayed in places in the same class that have a coffee pot and hair dryer in the room. Even some complimentary coffee in the lobby would have been nice. There is no elevator in the hotel, so if climbing stairs is an issue, you can request a room on a lower floor. I didn't expect much for the price, but it was actually a bit less than I expected. However, nothing about this hotel impacted my visit to Montreal in a negative way, so I will summarize by saying it was ok but could have been better. I'd probably look into some other options if I were to return to the city.",2,0
Hôtel de Paris,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Here is your fair warning....we had belongings taken from our room while we were out exploring for the day! What?! That's not the worst part. When we told the man at the desk, Alex, he brushed us off, and basically laughed at us. We tried to explain it to the next staff member, Patrick, who blamed us for losing the items, and STORMED out of the hotel during our discussion never to be seen.

Hôtel de Paris,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","One thing that you gotta know about Hotel de Paris is that this is a 2 star hotel. Don't expect the usual bell and whistles that you get from a 3 or a 4 star hotel. When we arrived, the staff was friendly and helpful. We arrived at around 1PM, two hours before the actual check in, but they allowed us to use the room right away because it was already empty. The check in was fast and efficient. The room was small (as we expected), but at least we had our own bathroom. It took us a while to figure out how to work the air conditioner, but the thing worked fine. We couldn't find hair dryer -- as it turned out, you need to borrow this from the reception. I had three issues with this hotel: The desk and the phone were dusty, and the hot water in the shower did not always work well. Also, the free ""continental"" breakfast was actually just croissant with some fruits. (They will give you a coupon for discounts if you want to get something else.) This was a good budget hotel, and we might come back if we absolutely couldn't book anywhere else. The location was a good 10 minute walk from The Village and was accessible to transit.",2,0
Hôtel de Paris,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Il y a quelques années, je suis venue à Montréal avec des copines pour voir un concert au Centre Bell.

Hôtel de Paris,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Where do I even begin to describe the atrocity that is the Hotel De Paris. I once stayed in a hostel in Cambodia and awoke to a rat gnawing gently at my face, and strangely this experience was not nearly as troubling as my experience at the HDP. Upon arrival you enter a cheery converted Victorian mansion tastefully done in muted pastels and with plenty of exposed refinished wood to greet you, and for a brief moment you feel that you may have found the best deal in Montreal-but then you are quickly ""relocated"" to their other heritage building or 'D block"" as we heard it lovingly referred to by a fellow traveller. We were told that there was a ""problem"" in our booking and that they were unable to accommodate the original terms of the booking, but that they had vacancy in their second heritage building and that essentially we had to accept this or could find other accommodation. Seeing that we were staying on a Saturday during the May long weekend, and had previously scoured the city for other vacancies we were not in a negotiating position. We drove the short two minutes to the second building and couldn't find it. We then saw a small sign indicating that we were in fact smack in front of it, but this couldn't be. There was trash strewn in all directions at the entrance and the door that was supposed to be locked was flung open haphazardly. After descending the few steps to our new subterranean chamber we tentatively entered and were greeted with a pungent mix of body odour, hairspray and urine. It was also suffocatingly humid and even the walls appeared to be sweating in revulsion. We slithered our way to dorm ""K"" where I was astonished to see what appeared to be an old cold storage room stacked with multiple rickety bunk beds. Now to say that three people would have been comfortable in such a space would be fair, but twelve! There was absolutely nowhere to store luggage-I ended up sleeping with my backpack and using it as a makeshift pillow, do to the fact that the provided pillow was caked with an indeterminable black dusting. It was quickly noted that two of the four washrooms on the unit were out of order. the third would quickly follow. We calculated that there were approximately three washrooms for upwards of thirty people. I made several calls to the front desk to alert them to the potential revolt that they would almost certainly have when fellow travellers would be returning from their nights of debauchery in Canada's sin city, yet despite this act of civic duty on my behalf no attempt was made to rectify the situation. It wasn't until the following mid afternoon as we were preparing to check out that I saw a housekeeper gingerly approach with a mop and plunger in hand. Evidently she knew what to expect, I certainly wish we did. Now it is important to stress that I do not have a personal vendetta or any ill will toward the HDP, I simply feel the strong need to make people aware that they should never ever consider staying here. It baffles me that such a place continues to operate in a pseudo successful manner. They must bank on the fact that those spending any time in HDP are so traumatized by their experiences that they vow to never speak of it again and hence don't spread the word that it should be avoided at all costs. In writing this very lengthy review it was my vow to break this silence, and hope that it may deter others from spending their hard earned dollars here.",1,0

Inn On the Mexican War Streets,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel","I stayed at The Inn on Mexican War Streets for one night in late May, 2014.

While not in pristine condition, the inside is certainly not shabby, and is clean. My bed was very comfortable. I met only one of the two innkeepers (sorry, I don't recall his name), but he was very nice and helpful. I wouldn't say the neighborhood is packed with restaurants and bars, but there are several (good ones!) within a three to four block walk.

When we left the Inn, we had to go to McDonald's to get an internet connection in order to research other hotel possibilities for the 3 nights we were displaced. (3) The second night, we were the ONLY guests in the Inn, so there was no one else there to be ""understanding."" We were only informed about the death in Karl's family as he was demanding that we leave while screaming at us about being ""privileged"" and from California. (4) We were charged $111.66 too much up front for the 5 nights when we arrived for our stay at the Inn. To date, we are still waiting for that amount to be refunded. It is certainly NOT TRUE that we received a refund for the nights we stayed, although we feel that kind of refund would be entirely appropriate considering the harsh treatment and lack of services. We are sorry that the innkeepers see this as ""an inconvenience."" We see it as a very ugly and disturbing incident that ruined many hours of our time and cast a pall over the rest of our vacation.",1,0

The Inn itself is gorgeous inside and out and Karl is a fabulous and gracious host. Our room, which included a private bath and sitting area was beautiful, clean, and very comfortable. The free wi-fi came in handy and was easily accessible from our room (the Emma room). Breakfast, though self serve, was good. There is a waffle maker and a toaster for English muffins or bagels. Fruit, pastries, cereal, and yogurt were also available, along with hard-boiled eggs. Street parking was never a problem and we felt very safe while staying at the Inn.

Inn On the Mexican War Streets,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel","My wife and I were at the Inn on Mexican War Streets recently for one night, Karl upgraded us and we loved the Inn, our room and the breakfast. After checking in, we went for a self-guided walking tour of the historic district - the people out seemed very friendly. Karl was very nice, answered all kinds of questions, was of great help with our getting to our dinner reservation (stay off the freeways). The breakfast area was really fun - all self-serve, my wife made herself some waffles - great food. The Inn is located across from a park, which we also explored. Street parking was fine, no problems. Our room (the back big room) was very nice, the high bed was large and amusing. No complaints whatsoever, highly recommend Karl's labor of love (didn't meet his partner), Karl sounds like a real urban pioneer of older Pittsburgh and he was a teacher (I think teachers make great BnB owners) - if we are ever in Pittsburgh again, we will look forward to another stay at the Inn on Mexican War Streets - thanks!",5,1
Inn On the Mexican War Streets,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel","My husband and I were in Pittsburgh for the NHL Winter Classic on New Year's Day. We spent three nights here and loved it. We had the Mr. Boggs room which faces the street and over looks the park across the street (in the picture, the 3 windows on the second floor are Mr. Boggs room). The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The entire Inn was beautifully decorated for Christmas. Karl and Jeff are wonderful hosts. We had made dinner reservations at a local restaurant, but upon arrival at the Inn were told that Jeff prepared a special New Year's eve dinner for the guests. He is a wonderful chef...dinner was delicious. The next morning he prepared a special New Year's Day breakfast of quiche and potatoes, in addition to the cold, every day breakfast items the normally serve. The restaurant is only open for private dinners. I suggest taking bottled water, wine/beer, sodas & snacks with you, as there is nothing ""right there"" to get those types of things.

Johnnie Walker RV Center,"Automotive, Hotels & Travel, RV Rental, Auto Parts & Supplies, Body Shops, RV Dealers","Now remember Johnnie Walker is a Dealer of Recreational Vehicles and Motor Homes, they are selling product not manufacturing it. I won't mention any manufacturers but when you buy from Johnnie Walker they back up what they sell. They are very busy yes and will address any manufacturers issues you might have. Again keep in mind that they don't control the factory they fix the screw ups from the factory and all the factories screw ups. Now these guys are the very best, When you need something stop by thier store, it may cost a bit more than Amazon but you will get the part you need, not the hose for your grill that is not the right part or have to wait until it is delivered. I can't say enough about the service. Try to get anything done with Camping world or Blue Dog RV and you have to wait 6 weeks. You guys Rock. Thank you.",5,1

We absolutely love Johnnie Walker. My fiancé and I began looking for our toy hauler last summer and we went from place to place looking for the best one. Unfortunately our options were limited due to the size (height) of our toy and the overall weight of the toy hauler itself. We finally met our sales person, Gina and she was attentive and patient, as we explained exactly what we were looking for. Gina provided us timely communication of different options as they became available. While we initially went in for a used toy hauler, we ended up buying a brand new one, which really made me happy. Once we made our purchase, Chase was helpful as we did our inspection walk through. He answered all of our questions and even did some demonstrations while we recorded them in preparation for our first trip. Absolutely incredible!

After five days of waiting, and having left two messages for someone to call me back, I instead went to eBay and found the part for 156.00. While waiting for eBay seller to ship, Johnny Walker's parts desk called me about the part, and put me on hold again while they searched for it. 7-8 minutes later, they informed me they didn't have it but could special order it (common electrical part for RV) for 249.99, nearly $100.00 more.

I took it to a Cat dealer at 1st and the warranty wasn't going to covering anything. Then we found out that the cool air charger wasn't working and thankfully they would cover that, but would not cover the radiator. I bought this RV in April 2015. Yes, it was a used coach. I should of taken it and had someone check it out, before purchasing. Now we have to take it in yet again, this time for electrical problems and the toilet is leaking. I hope that this under warranty. I just hope it is covered. (I hate writing a bad reviews) The sales person was great and Warranty person was great. I just wish Johnnie Walker would of helped with the radiator. I heard Finnally RV helped someone that brought a used coach from them when they founded out they sold a bad coach. Our part of the bill was $5400. All I wanted them to do is help with the radiator. But they said no. So I am now taking everything off my coach that says Johnnie Walker.

Johnnie Walker RV Center,"Automotive, Hotels & Travel, RV Rental, Auto Parts & Supplies, Body Shops, RV Dealers","I waited to write this review till after I used my trailer a few times and took it in for it's first service. The reason being is because you can have the best sales person in the world and once they have your money it turns into a nightmare really fast. My friend and I bought travel trailers the same exact week. I did my research and chose Johnny Walker RV based on not only the good reviews but because they are locally and family owned. My friend chose Camping World even though I warned him that the internet was full of horrible reviews about them but he totally ignored me and bought from them anyway and I can tell you first hand his experience has been a total nightmare compare to mine. From the first time I walked into JW RV it was smooth sailing, Jared Munk my sales guy was friendly and knowledgeable about everything I needed to know and guided me through the entire process without any issues. After looking at all the models I decided to go with the Jayco 26BHS and my only regret is that I wish I got the next model up with the larger bathroom. My friend who bought from Camping world and I went on our first trip together to Pachanga Lake (north campground) on Jared my sales guy's advise and it was great. I had no issues at all while my friend who bought the Key Stone Cougar had nothing but problems which ended up making my trip stressful because everything on his trailer kept breaking and I had to help him deal with all the BS. First we could not get the trailer off his truck because camping world hooked everything up wrong, then his gas valve broke and his stove and fridge quit working, then we could not get the trailer back on the hitch, then his bathroom door kept opening up driving down the road all while I had no major issues at all. After we returned my friend and I both dropped off our trailers for service, my list was short and I just needed a few things tightened up and my friend needed all his issues fixed. Well long story short my trailer was ready to pick up a few days later and more then a month later camping world is still waiting for Key Stone to give the green light to fix his stuff and my friend has missed out on using his trailer twice. Bottom line is if you want a huge headache go buy your trailer or RV from anyone else other then Johnny Walker, if you want no hassles and great customer service from start to finish then Johnny Walker RV is the only choice in my opinion.",5,1

The slide never worked right. When we were in Las Vegas, we decided to take the RV in to Johnnie Walker RV and see if they could fix it. Ed (Service Writer) was the best. The slide was fixed correctly and still operates perfectly to this day. He also knew what was wrong with my emergency brake and fixed that in about 1/2 hour.

La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix West Peoria,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","I have stayed at this La Quinta a few times. Between the last two times I've stayed there, the hotel did a major remodel. What a difference it has made! When hotels tell you they've recently done a remodel, it usually means they've repainted, laid new carpet, etc. But, then there are layers of caulking in the bathroom and it's an improvement. This was something else! The hotel looked fresh and new inside and out. They outdated bathtubs have been replaced with beautiful shower stalls and sliding glass doors. Very nice. The only thing I would like to see improved upon is the cleanliness of the breakfast area. I know the turnover is high with a complimentary breakfast, but it would have been nice to see the tables getting wiped off every once in a while.",4,1

The front desk staff is so helpful and friendly. Every and all request I had were handled quickly and professionally. Plenty of parking and close to shopping and food. They accept large dogs and have a grassy area for them which was a plus especially during the summer heat. Always plenty at breakfast no matter what time I went, ice water at front desk and baked cookies in the evening.

The rooms are clean and the beds are comfy. After check-out I had an issue that was immediately resolved by the manager. I couldn't have asked for better customer service.

La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix West Peoria,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","This happened in late March early April 2015. And I am going to post now because apparently I missed letting people know about this place on here... So March 30, 2015 my house caught fire and not only burned down completely but killed pets and did catch the neighboring homes on fire as well although only one was left with significant damage of those homes. I needed a place to stay for a few days. My fiance took me there after a couple other places were already booked. It was 5am by the time we walked in the doors there to see if they had a room. I was covered in soot, having only had the clothes on my back. So the lady at the front desk was SUPER kind and got us a room right away. So things were good.. until I decided to extend my stay, go to the front desk and she has a bill saying I have already extended my stay. I thought that was pretty odd, her demeanor was very cold and rude. So I called my fiance and he said no he had signed for it and I was supposed to have it until the next day and then any extension I needed beyond that was up to me. So I asked to see the receipt. She handed it to me and as I'm reading it I said ""wait this is crossed..."" as I spoke the words she RIPPED it from my hands... on the receipt that my fiance signed, they had scribbled out the date he signed for. ILLEGALLY. This place is truly something else... So then she went to get her manager after and I grabbed it from behind the counter and took pictures. Well the manager actually yells at me for reaching over the counter... in case you've missed the chick whose home and pets are gone... this manager yells at me for reaching behind the counter to take pictures of THIS HOTEL... THIS ONE... trying to ILLEGALLY change dates on a SIGNED RECEIPT. So PLEASE... stay anywhere else. They are criminals.",1,0
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix West Peoria,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel",Stayed here for one of my quadruplets to have surgery. She is 3. Received a bill for a $250 cleaning fee for smoking in the room. Did not happen! We smoked in the court yard area by the gated pool so that my children could play. We also do not smoke in a closed area with our children. I'm assuming the smell is from our clothes. They also complained that there was blood on the sheets which was from my daughter having surgery. We were unaware she would bleed after. We also got charged more then our quoted price and we are elite members. My daughter needs several more surgeries and I'm never staying at a La Quintana again. We have quadruplets and are on one income. I now get to pay almost $400 for a 2 night stay at a hotel that has now degraded us. Anyone who has Surgery at the Peoria Surgery center stay away from a hotel that has no decency towards other people's pain and suffering. I'm bawling my eyes out for something that never happened.,1,0

La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix West Peoria,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Stayed the weekend of September 12-14. I think LaQuintas usually are clean and have great rates. Our room was clean, beds were comfortable, ( even though they were double beds no queen :( ) the French doors to the bathrooms were adorable, the court yard was cute, the lights around the gazebo had that perfect touch, and staff was wonderful!! We had a working fridge microwave and cool AC in our room. We swam a lot while we were here since it was so hot, and the staff must have checked the pools at least twice a day...I have never seen this happen so often, glad they care enough to check the chlorine levels and took the time to clean them in the early mornings!!! However we couldn't figure out how to turn on the hot tub. The button was not visible at all! Main elevator was slow though...not sure why since the sides ones were fast. Great location, in the middle of several restaurants and shopping..all within walking distance. Plenty of parking, well lit parking too! Definitely will be staying again...",4,1
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix West Peoria,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel",I don't understand there low ratings this hotel has recurved. First of all its LA Quinta so it cannot compare to a five star hotel. For this level hotel it is great! They allowed me to check in 4 hours early. Pet friendly with no extra pet fees!!! The young lady at the front desk was very friendly and efficient. The facilities are good. Breakfast is standard. I would definitely stay again.,5,1
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix West Peoria,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Disgusting! Do not stay here! It was very clear the room they put us in was not clean. The sheets were filthy and stained. If everything else in the area is booked, do yourself a favor, go somewhere else.",1,0
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix West Peoria,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","GREAT rates!!! The location of this La Quinta is also ideal as it is near some major stores and restaurants. It is within walking distance to Target and restaurants like Tilted Kilt, Hooters, Chipotle, Red Robin, Chick-fil-A, and in-n-out that surround the hotel! This La Quinta is not only adjacent to a popular strip mall but also located near the Padres/Mariners spring training field. Also located off the AZ Loop 101 Customer service is great. The front desk agent, breakfast attendant, and housekeeping were all very nice. The hallways and lobby are all updated for a clean look. Free wifi within the rooms. Free parking as well. The La Quinta brand in general is pet-friendly - an added plus when I am traveling with dogs and don't want to look for other pet friendly hotels, I can count on La Quinta to welcome my dogs! However the rooms themselves were sub par. They weren't the best but not the worst either. The bathroom was not clean. The tub had dark marks where the tub non-slip grips were. Almost as if the grips caught on to the dirt of guests past and would not let go. Eww. Further around the base of the toilet was hair from previous guests. (know it wasn't mine because I literally just got there.) The carpet was gross too. Dark stains populated the carpet implying the carpet had not shampooed in a long time. For the price I paid I guess I can't argue with the quality. The bed was pretty comfortable and they had premium channels within our room as well. Given that though I wish the rooms were a little cleaner as this was my only complaint and enough to knock down a significant amount of stars in yelp ratings.",2,0

Two grown people most definitely do NOT sleep or fit comfortably!! Breakfast was decent. They offer waffles, cereal, juices & milk, some fruit, boiled eggs, yogurt, bagels or bread for toasting. The pool was nice as well as the pool area itself. The location is pretty centralized to a ton of restaurants, sports complex, and shopping.",2,0
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix West Peoria,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel","Our AC went out on one of the hottest day of the year (114 degrees during the day and 90s at night) and it was unbearable in the house. We have two dogs and they were quite unhappy as well. We looked for hotels in the area and remembered some friends stayed at La Quinta before. One of our main deciding factors to go to La Quinta was the fact that they allowed pets without any fees. As long as you go into the hotel understanding that it's not going to be a 5-star resort, you'll enjoy it. The check-in area was clean and looked inviting. The hallways were clean and bright. The room was standard, but our room had a fridge, microwave and couch (executive suite). The bed was comfortable (better than my bed at home). The sheets were crisp and very clean and the pillows were awesome too. The TV in the room had HD channels and appeared to be a full selection. Best of all, the room did not smell or look like other pets had been there. If you're not from the area, it's situated in a great area for food and entertainment. A little downer were the bathroom cups--they weren't glass, think office coffee area but wrapped individually. The bathroom was quite plain, but I didn't really mind. The continental breakfast was pretty good as well. Make your own waffles, muffins, toast/bagels, cereal, coffee and juice.",4,1

In the morning I emptied my cigar wrap to re-use later in the day. Later I noticed a 250 smoking charge on my card. I called 4-5 times and left messages with no response! Finally two weeks later I get in touch with a supervisor to explain to him the situation. His first words are ""we can not take this charge off your card"" When I responded by telling him the costumer service told me he was the only one that could handle it, he corrected himself and said ""we can take the charge off, but we won't.""

Las Vegas Marriott,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel","Don't fall for Marriott's scam telemarketing ""free vacation scam"". After getting 3-4 robo calls a day, I tried to get taken off their list. They wouldn't listen to anything, but just kept pushing the sale and finally relented saying ""they'd think about it"". That's the same rude attitude I've received when I've gone somewhere and had to choose between a Motel 6 and the Marriott. The decor looks nicer, but the rooms are just as smelly and dingy (in fact, I never found a used condom at a Motel 6, but I have at a Marriott). I'd sleep in my car before I'd ever stay at another Marriott. Obviously they reduction in quality is being felt in lower occupancy rates so they aren forced to resort to heavy handed telemarketing.",1,0
Las Vegas Marriott,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel","I don't understand some of the negative reviews here. Marriott is not on the strip, and the view rooms don't have a direct view of the strip. However, the hotel doesn't market themselves in a way where you would think they were a property immediately on the strip. Thus, I wouldn't recommend booking a view room for this purpose. Save the money! To get to the strip, simply take the team. Very easy! Again, this isn't a strip view property. The pool isn't great nor are the concierge and restaurant booking services; hence, this is a hotel more geared towered business travelers and not leisure travelers. For business purposes, this hotel was great. If you are traveling on leisure, there are a few less expensive Marriott options closer to strip that are much better. Sure, they may not have a great pool, but they include small kitchen. My rating is 5 star for business and 3 star for leisure. Net 4 stars!",4,1
Las Vegas Marriott,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel","As a Platinum member, who has stayed to many nights in hotels, this is one of my least favorites. The front desk seems nice but really don't care about your status and puts out the minimalist of service. The hotel is old, terrible pool, and to access the pool you need to go through the front parking lot. The amenities are laughable and again insulting, no concierge lounge, 10 dollars credit towards a drink which cost twice as much or the 500 bonus points which have not increased in at least 20 years. Marriott is becoming equal to a low end Holiday Inn.",1,0
Las Vegas Marriott,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel","DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL IF YOU ARE A MARRIOTT REWARDS MEMBER!!!!!

She was told she couldn't get any of the benefits that are given to a Platinum Marriott Reward member as I wasn't there yet. Which means she misses out on the breakfast buffet. They also should have upgraded the room with at least a view. Being a Platinum Reward Member doesn't mean anything to this hotel. I spoke with the Marriott Platinum Reward line and explained what happened, they were shocked, they proceeded to tell met, this hotel carries the Marriott name, but technically they aren't a Marriott hotel. Basically what it boils down to as I stayed at this hotel for the service I definitely should receive for being such a loyal customer and I was definitely not rewarded for doing so. I also what to mention that the hotel manager argued for at least 10 minutes on the phone with the Platinum Reward Rep. He told them he wasn't going to budge even if it meant that he would lose a 20 year plus customer.

We received 5-star service from the local staff--especially Julia B at the front desk. I enjoyed the property, which was definitely up to Marriott standards, and particularly liked that it did not have a casino.

Their was a coffee maker (they did have two bottles of purified water, but if you open one they will charge you $3.50 a bottle ), and a small fridge.

We didn't think it could get any better than our first day but the next morning we met Geraldo in the restaurant for breakfast and he shared places outside of Las Vegas we could experience, (since we aren't much of gamblers more concert goers). Finally, we met our housekeeper and requested additional coffee for the room and she was happy to accommodate. Next time we go to Vegas this is definitely where we will stay. In terms of the room we were on the 11th floor, the room was spacious clean. The beds in the rooms are extremely comfortable making a very restful sleep.",5,1

French doors separated the bedroom from the living room. There was a small kitchenette, with fridge, sink and coffee maker. No microwave. The beds are very comfortable (per usual Marriott standards). I really appreciated the decor in this hotel. Natural textured wallpaper throughout and richly colored walls in the bedroom. Nice touches. The pool is kind of small but clean, and the patio area is pretty nice. Great price and good location right behind the strip where the Wynn/ Encore and Palazzo are. The gym is also small but I guess not that many people are working out in Vegas. Free parking and a breakfast buffet (which is a bit pricey but everything on it was fresh and good). Great value.

My reservation had a special rate, but the front desk lady would not let me check-in because I didn't have the proper ID to secure the rate. I informed her my coworker who would be arriving, would have the proper ID and paperwork for both our rooms. She said there was nothing she could do. So I sat and waited in the lobby for 45 minutes for my coworker to arrive. As soon as my coworker arrived, another front desk associate was helping him and didn't ask for any ID or paperwork at all. My coworker is also a Marriott Rewards member, either silver or gold, so he was being treated very well. I come up behind my coworker and start talking to him and all of a sudden the lady who would not let me check in says she was looking for me and would've let me into the room and checked ID later. Well lady, I was sitting in the lobby the whole time and not once did you ever make an effort to look for me. YOU ARE A LIAR and full of BS. Not to mention, you never checked for ID or paperwork later. This experience made me appreciate Hilton Hotels so much more. They have never hassled me and not let me check-in with the special rate. The rooms themselves were very nice, but I would never come back here because of the way I was treated.",1,0

I was then told that we were changing buses, which was fine for me. The layout was different on the second bus, where it had 4 rows of 3 seats, all of them joined.

His name was Edgar and he was very friendly. The bus has 24 leather reclining seats, outlets, and wifi which works from time to time. My 8AM ride was on a Thursday, and I arrived safe and sound in LA by 12:45 exactly. Overall, I am very pleased with the service.

He really enjoys his job, as we traveled from Mesa, I watched him wave to oncoming buses and patrons standing at the stops.It was a full ride as so many were headed downtown. Only irritating part is the people that scan your tickets, don't stay on the entire ride and we had to have our tickets scanned 3 times by 3 different people. Our ride back was a little more interested. It was Saturday night at 11pm, what was I expecting! I told my kids to stay together and hang onto their belongings as it was a little scary riding back with some free entertainment. The young man with the really loud boom box playing rap music, which I didn't mind, it was enjoyable, but as he exited a drunk man entered and he had many people laughing as he was way over intoxicated and singing and swearing, it was wild!

If you're stuck on a long layover at Sky Harbor, take the Air Train to the light rail connection at 44th and Washington and head west, towards 19th/Montebello. Heading into Downtown, you'll pass by a few sites including the homes of the Diamondbacks (Chase Field) and Suns (US Airways Arena), see some everyday Phoenician businesses and avoid having to deal with parking. A few stops offer food options as well, within a short walk in most cases. End-to-end, the line is about an hour's trip. There's art, some shade and even a few placards about the area's history at stations too (interested in reading about suburban development in the Phoenix area?

Hey Yelp HQ nannies. I've ridden it a number of times, it sucks. And I pay for it every time I buy something whether I ride it or not because of the sales tax. And it makes left turns on Central Ave a pain in the ass. So if that doesn't constitute experience with the business, please tell me what does the next time you remove my review. It's slow and a bad value, and it only is useful if you're going to go from a place within a few blocks, to a place within a few blocks. There is limited space for bicycles. If time and money have no value to you, I guess that 5 stars makes sense. If you still think it's worth 5 stars, I want some of what you're smoking, because $1.75 for a service that costs $15 out of the pockets of others to provide. Shocking. If we bought each rider a brand new Prius III for $23,000 it would cost us just over $425 million, that is nearly ONE BILLION DOLLARS LESS than the $1.4 billion we pay to move them by rail, instead. 80% of ridership are former bus riders, so it hardly removes any cars from the road.

METRO light rail,"Hotels & Travel, Public Services & Government, Transportation, Public Transportation","I love the light rail. I mean, LOVE, the light rail. First off, it takes me less than 2 minutes to drive to the nearest stop.. 44th and Washington... and when weather permits, I can easily ride a bike there... Second, it takes me to all of the best places. George and Dragon, Fez, Clarendon, Portland's, Fate, Sens, Amsterdam's, The Embassy, Robert and Bacon's apartment... etc etc etc. Third, on NYE I was able to take the light rail from my apartment to all of the places I wanted to go, and didn't run the risk of having to drive drunk or spend $20 each way on a cab ride. I have been on the trains in both Boston and New York and it feels pretty equitable to me. Obviously it is way cleaner, and I hope that the nightly steam cleanings each car will get helps keep it that way. It has been really busy because it's free, of course, but I really hope that people take the time to give LR a chance. I think it is a really good step in the right direction for us.

Mandalay Bay Sports Book,"Arts & Entertainment, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Casinos, Hotels, Resorts","My father, brother-in-law and I have been going here for the first weekend of March Madness for six years. In that time, a lot has changed, and a lot has stayed the same. First off: it's easily one of the largest sports books in Vegas, with loads of seating, TVs and board space with betting propositions. The space is the primary reason we've been loyal. They did update the projector a couple years ago to a brighter, HD picture, which is nice. However, relative to some of the mega-sharp and ultra-bright options elsewhere on the Strip, the A/V here is pretty geriatric. At least on our weekend, you now either bet a LOAD (hundreds-plus) of money for each proposition for a drink voucher or two, or you pay cash or credit for your drinks. And yes, Vegas pricing applies: think minimum of $10 per drink. The ceiling is high, which helps smoke waft upward and onward, however sometimes the pure quantity of smokers outweighs the height and/or any system employed to move the smoke along. Related side note (with semi-pre-apology to smokers): Too many people here are NOT heeding the Surgeon General's (and every other of the trillion-or-so published medical mind's) warnings to go ahead and quit the single-worst, nastiest habit ever known to man. Where is the upside to hacking up an emphysema-ridden lung the last third of your life? Just because you CAN smoke inside here doesn't mean you should. There's a door to the great outdoors about a two minute walk away from the book. The weather's lovely outside - go check it out. Rant aside, for what it is, this sports book averages out great space with a low-tech approach for a down-the-middle overall rating. A few more comped drinks for paying customers would go a long way toward helping the less-attractive A/V look much better (wink wink)!!",3,0

Fortunately I found out later that I don't have to use the dealer. Here is why... Firstly, their service price for the B3 service is around $700 after tax. While there are some parts changes, the majority of the work on this service is fluid changes & diagnostics & can be done by many other mechanics for under $200. My biggest issue with them was they billed me for something I did not order: An Interior Air Quality Service which costs $59.95 + tax! Fortunately I managed to talk to the service manager and he agreed that there was nothing mentioned on the bill of service beforehand about this work being performed but I now have to go out of my way and make a return trip to the dealership to get a refund. This really seems like a case of a service advisor taking advantage of a customer and trying to tack on unnecessary service in hopes of a higher commission. This is not something I expect from Mercedes-Benz dealer and one of the reasons why I go to the dealer in the first place. In fact, they would have gotten away with this had I not taken a very close look at my bill and for this reason (regardless of a refund) I will never take my car back to them for service.

Meridian Condo Resorts,"Resorts, Active Life, Vacation Rentals, Hotels, Golf, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services","Hard to rate this place based on how it was advertised. Definitely had the impression it was a resort we were headed to. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. We ended up at the Gleneagles Condo which was a gated apartment complex by the TCP Golf course. BE AWARE...where you pick up your keys IS NOT the property. It is an office that leaves your keys in an envelope outside after hours. That was a SURPRISE! Thinking we were going crazy driving around in circles looking for the Meridian Resort when in fact MERIDIAN is not a resort at all! Once we found it, after driving around in circles for 20 minutes and phoning the 1-800 number on the website our boys thought it was great. Positives: large 3 bedroom all with king size beds, clean, full kitchen, lots of tvs, quiet neighbourhood and I think in a very safe area (it was dark when we arrived), price point for size was good compared to a 2 hotel rooms in the area, private attached garage, comfortable, AC and fans Negatives: not good for anyone who can't do stairs (narrow flight steep to main apartment), older - stains on carpet, craftsmanship and paint job poor, kitchen supplies minimal for a ""time share"" type facility, (no dish soap, kitchen towels or cloths, no coffee but a coffee maker). Challenging when you get in late at night. On a flight path (Scottsdale airport). Poor insulation between apartments - could hear neighbours moving around Cannot comment on pool or other amenities - only stayed one night as we had previously booked another resort prior to arriving early. I'm hoping that the other resort is more resort like - I'll yelp that one too later. However, saying all this - and once you are settled this is a fine place for a few nights - we were here for a kids baseball tournament so we weren't really going to be at the ""resort"" much anyway. Gave you a nice roomy location where you could cook your own meals. Compared to other prices in the area during spring training it was a better deal with more room.

There are apartment complexes that they rent rooms out of that are not even located at the address listed, but are 15 minutes away from 8390 E Via De Ventura. One apartment complex is called Deltona(which is far from major shopping off of Thompson Peak Pkwy and McDowell Mountain Ranch Rd) and the another is called Crown Court; both complexes are nice and in a nice area, but still far from a resort which is what we thought we were paying for. You have to pay extra to get room service and there is no spa or anything on sight. I was wanting a resort for my birthday weekend and was sadly let down, to say the least. Secondly, we ended up staying an extra night and had to switch rooms and move to another apartment complex, which was not a big deal, however, the room they moved us to had black mold in the hallway bathroom, which we did not realize until later in the evening after the office had closed for the day as we were out running errands all day. When we attempted to contact the office for compensation for the final night only, the office staff was uncooperative and refused to do anything about it. Mind you, I have asthma and I could've had an extremely bad reaction to the mold. I should have taken my business elsewhere and regret even staying at this place. If you are looking for a resort, do your research and find an actual resort that is in the area.

Mesa Air Group,"Transportation, Airlines, Hotels & Travel","This review pertains to their subsidiary airline, ""Go!"" in the Hawaiian islands. Don't Fly Go! Wow! I have never run into a less competent airline. These people couldn't run a bicycle-rickshaw taxi service, let alone an airline. If you're spending a lot of money to come and enjoy the islands, don't do what I've done, which is book interisland flights through go. They'll be at least an hour late most of the time. However, today one flight left 12 minutes early, and so I missed my connection. I watched my aircraft pull away as I was arriving on another - they couldn't hold it for two minutes. Why? Because they don't care. At all! Not even a little. No apology for allowing an aircraft to leave 12 minutes early, consigning me to an later flight. This is, fortunately, the last flight I've booked with Go, and I will never, ever book another flight with them, or with any other Mesa Air Group airline.",1,0
Mesa Temple Visitors' Center,"Visitor Centers, Hotels & Travel, Churches, Religious Organizations, Travel Services","Incredible Easter Pagent. It really puts a light on the true meaning of Easter. The music, lighting, actors, and costumes were all superb. I was touched by the way they shared the life of the Savior Jesus Christ. There was also no fee or ticket required. This incredible performance is for everyone to enjoy!",5,1

Stop at the food trucks if you go on the weekends. Plus you can take the light rail down Main and enjoy Merry Main.,5,1
Mesa Temple Visitors' Center,"Visitor Centers, Hotels & Travel, Churches, Religious Organizations, Travel Services",Came to the temple lights with my family and went through the visitor center. They had nativity scenes from dozens of different countries out on display. It was amazing to see how different cultures were expressed through the art work that was displayed. There was an interactive experience on families and another short video they were showing. A lot of history about temples was on display as well so you can learn more of their meaning and why they are important. They had a few musical numbers that was done outside by an amazing singer and musicians. Going to see the temple lights it's a big even for our family. We all one together and enjoy the lights that many people worked on for our enjoyment. You can find people selling hot chocolate across the street from the visitor center as well. Parking can be a little bit crazy during the temple lights so you will need to park further way and walk to the visitor center. This is a great place to learn more about the Church or Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.,5,1

Mesa Temple Visitors' Center,"Visitor Centers, Hotels & Travel, Churches, Religious Organizations, Travel Services","Last year, I asked Santa for the sexiest person ever for Christmas --- and I woke up in a box! ;D Probably not the best thing to say in a review for a church but let's be real! Anyways, we stumbled upon this place by accident. Like, we were across the street trying to catch some Magikarps and saw a wonderful light display and heard a lady's voice singing out Christmas carols. Upon further inspection, we found ourselves at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! What a lovely display! I had a lot of fun roaming the gardens and looking at the beautiful displays. The members of the church bellowed cheerful, ""Merry Christmas!"" and didn't approach you with anything more. I had expected some flyers to be handed to me and was pleasantly surprised when we were left to wander about freely. Lots of people and families were taking pictures and ooh-ing and ahh-ing over various performances and decorations. Truly a great place to visit during the holidays --- especially on Christmas Eve! Merry Christmas to my Yelp fam! May the new year bring some magic and laughter and I hope y'all surprise yourself in 2017! Happy birthday, Korean Jesus! #21JumpStreet",5,1

Motel 6,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Contrary to the last reviewer, this hotel, and surroundings kept me awake all night and concerned my vehicle would be stripped clean by morning. Where shall I start? How about the nearby McDonald's previously mentioned. While driving past McDonald's, which is next door to this hotel, I had the good fortune to witness a gentleman, sitting across from the drive through lanes, shooting up drugs into his arm. He was sitting on a curb, in plain view, took his time and had not a concern in the world about who watched. I know, because I slowed down to a snails pace just to make sure I wasn't imagining the scene. The *surprise* you're screwed reservation- I called this hotel a little before midnight inquiring about rooms, since most everything else was sold out or $300+. The front desk clerk told me yes, they had rooms, but to make them reservation online to secure the better rate. No problem. I made an online reservation... Obviously past the cutoff time. Nothing was EVER mentioned about smoking rooms. I was almost positive of that fact... I went back through the website with another reservation to verify... Yup. Nada mentioned. Once I arrived, however, the clerk said all she had was smoking rooms. Surprise! More annoying than the website's omission, was the way the clerk handled it. She made a comment about it having non-smoking rooms available since early afternoon. Why wouldn't a hotel clerk mention that fact- prior to directing you to make an online, no cancellation reservation? Wtf I took the room and headed to 3rd floor hell. Maybe it was the several guests handing out on the balconies at midnight, my neighbor smoking several substances all night, or the non-stop click clacking, ALL NIGHT, from the room directly above me... Or maybe it was the countless long black hairs I found through the room, bathroom and sink, or even possibly the multiple cigarette burn marks on the bathtub lip.... Regardless, nothing about this hotel provided a positive experience. The location, surroundings, vagrants, room cleanliness, and front desk clerk professionalism all fell short of even Motel 6's low standards. All this for $80+. Seasonal price gouging isn't anything new to Phoenix, although I didn't realize Motel 6 had joined the club. Even if you're dog-ass tired, it's ridiculously late and everything is sold out... Don't bother stopping here. Junkies in front, drunks in the back, and lots of signs informing you they aren't responsible for your car and contents... should they be broken into. You figure it out.",1,0
Motel 6,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","The staff is courteous and friendly and the morning coffee is good. For the price and last minute availability, you can always count on Motel 6. The $2.99/day Wi-Fi can add up pretty quick on top of the hotel bill, but that's not a deal breaker. Safe area, the rooms were clean, and the housekeeping was reliable and friendly also. Close to the grocery stores, fast food and restaurants, Pharmacy and even medical care facilities were all within walking distance. We'd stay there again, for sure. Thanks, Motel 6 for leaving the light on. :) Oh - and if you book your room online, there's considerable savings $$.",4,1
Motel 6,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Ok I happily realize you get what you pay for, but I'm also a believer that there are certain minimums to even low standards. We stay at motel 6 a lot, but this is the worst. Smallest room ever. Noticed what appeared to a super huge bloody booger smeared towards the ceiling. As I moved to the head of the bed realized it was spattered all over the curtain, ceiling, and the big smudge was almost 99% certainly blood. I'm not a paranoid person, but very weird. Enough I almost googled motel 6 murder. Not sure how this filthy curtain, blood or not, has not been washed. Room was non smoking, but smelled as if it was just smoked in before we arrived. Kept getting wafts of smoke smell, which I'm thinking is the neighbors as my dog keeps going to the base of our adjoining door and sniffing constantly. Dirty room. Toilet top had hair, dust, and trimmings. Had no towels in room anywhere, or soap, or anything aside from a floor mat laden with Chestal and pubic hair. I air dried from my shower instead. Too.late to request a towel. Right now, I'm just waiting for cockroaches to crawl into bed with me or to be broken into and robbed to top off the experience. As I mentioned, I can tolerate a lot and don't expect luxury for 50 bucks, but truck stops and their facilities are a better alternative. Do not stay here unless you have no car to sleep in, no friends pad to crash at, and no chance of meeting a random stranger to spend ten bucks more somewhere else and split the bill. Update: we did survive the night...barely. People yelling all night including some kid at 3am specifically hollering grandma..one person also went to their vehicle every 45 minutes to an hour for a moment and came back being the car each time and making sure to solidly slam their hotel door. Additionally around 3am I was hard from a semi sleep stage to a very caustic chemical smell. Don't know...Don't want to know. Left early this morning as soon as day broke.",1,0
Motel 6,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Extremely rude and unhelpful staff who flat-out lied in front of me. Or maybe they thought I am deaf. They ID'ed my friend, who was paying for the hotel, but then insisted that they had to see my ID. On top of that, they made a photocopy of my ID and couldn't answer any of my questions, like where this copy of my ID will be stored, who has access to it, and why they need to my ID in the first place. Clerk stated that it's a rule that has been around, and I asked, ""How long has it been around?"" to which she answered, ""A while."" Right, a while. Nice, non-specific answer. Right after she said that to me, she asked a co-worker to get her a sign, which she promptly put up saying that a NEW policy requires that all guests be ID'ed, even if they are not paying. I guess this new policy has been in effect for a while. Or maybe my command of English vocabulary is no good. Good thing my friend was with me, because I would've just left at that point if it had been just me. She also told me that only the cops have access to the copy of my ID.

We were supposed go get dinks at the foundation room next but he was rushing everyone and we were behind on time. I get it so we moved along. The a.c. on the bus wasn't working and that didn't help the situation since it was 105 and had over 30 people on the damn bus! He gave a long bullshit speech and part of that inculed being comfortable meaning ""ladies if those feet are hurting change your shoes we want you to have fun"" we kept that in mind since we brought Sandles. First club was Tao they made is throw away all medication......which was not mentioned in Matt's b.s. speech! It took so long to get in by the time we did we had to leave! Last club was the Cromwell and as we go to the door we are told we can't get in because we didn't have healed shoes!! After Matt told us it was ok. Matt was still there and argued with us that he never said that. It would of been fine but we sent our heal shoes with our party that called it quits for the night! We were the only group to tip and he got that tip just before we went to the Cromwell and since he got that he didn't even care.

NO dude, the whole bus is hot, the ac is broken and you shouldn't be running a tour in the daytime in las vegas while its 103 out, we definitely weren't the only ones who noticed. It obviously never cooled down because it was broken so there was never a place to cool down in the in between time as theres very little shade at the pools you go to. We went to the flamino which was nice, and daylight, after about 15 minuets there we left because there was no shade and it was just way too hot to have a good time there.

I saw the ad on groupon and wanted to buy from groupon but it didn't allow me to because it was the same day. So I called Party Tours directly and told them about groupon. They told me to buy directly thru them and they will treat it just as groupon. I had a bad feeling because groupon is awesome and if you have a problem with a company they immediately refund you. I went against my better judgement and I trusted the salesman at Party Tours. So...My out of state ID was not accepted into the club that the tour takes you to. So I was told I couldn't go on the tour anymore. The guide was nice until my situation occurred then he got rude. Therefore I spoke to customer service the next day and they assured me I would get refunded back for the tour. I was transferred to various people then told I would receive a call back. No one called me and every time I called them I would get the run around. Then eventually they started ignoring my calls all together. I hope the BBB (better business bureau) shuts them down!

We were told we HAD to check in by 9:30 or we would be left, but then waited until almost 11 to leave. Due to other people missing thier busses we had to wait for staff to figure out the mixup and then cram them onto our bus. There were at least 5 people standing at all times. The bus itself was disgusting, no nice seats or lights like thr website advertises. There was one strobe light and gross ratty seats. The 'stripper pole' wasnt securely attached to the floor and the was no room for dancing in the isles at all. It was deathly hot in our bus, when we asked for higher air conditioning we are told it was as high as it could go. It was disgusting. Our bus driver parked in horrible places where we had to walk up steep hills upon exit, wearing heels as the website demanded. There were girls on our bus wearing casual outfits and flat shoes who were allowed in each club, something the website stated was unacceptable. The 2 options of 'drinks' that were made on the bus were disgusting and the beer was warm. We were brought to different clubs then promised because we left so late and got to the last club so late (3:15am) we couldn't get in. One of the members in our group lost his wedding ring while on the bus. Our tour guide called the bus driver and asked him to look in the cooler for the ring. The bus driver lied about looking in the bus cooler for the wedding ring. He stated he looked and could not find it, that member went to check the cooler again & found it easily. Liar liar his pants are on fire. Due to this terrible experience no one in our 17 person group will ever utilize this shit service again. We have repeatedly asked to speak with someone from the company but have been denied. DO NOT waste your time or money on this company!!

During her drunken state she spilt her drink all over the paid customers and she was trying to do demonstrate a striptease type dance showing everything under her skirt.

Party Tours,"Event Planning & Services, Nightlife, Dance Clubs, Party Bus Rentals, Tours, Limos, Bus Tours, Bars, Transportation, Club Crawl, Hotels & Travel","We rented a party bus from Party Tours Las Vegas for our K-pop party weekend in Vegas. The theme was ""EVERYTHING KOREAN"". We planned to eat Korean, sing Korean karaoke, play at the Korean spa, and jam out to K-pop in a party bus on the strip. Party Tours was great when I called to make reservations and explained that it was all about the K-Pop. It was pretty simple: we just wanted to bring our own iPod full of our favorite K-Pop and drive up and down the strip for a couple of hours. They were very happy to accomodate this and confirmed with me several times. My complaint? When the party bus showed up at our designated spot and I gave the driver my iPod and he looked surprised and told me the iPod player wasn't working. Nobody had communicated to him our plan which centered around listening to K-Pop. We HAD to listen to K-Pop! That was the WHOLE IDEA! The party bus plan was absolutely pointless without K-Pop. Luckily after messing around with it for a while, the iPod player started working and our night wasn't a total bust...but it could have been and I was still very upset that there was no communication between the coordinator and the driver. Few other complaints- the a/c wasn't working in part of the bus and it was hot. Also, they dropped us off 11 minutes early even though we had pre-paid and tipped generously. Was not expecting anything more- but felt jipped- I expected to get our full time. Also- they took us on the freeway in the beginning which wasted a bunch of time that we wanted to spend just going up and down the strip. Our driver was kind of a jerk and did not seem to enjoy what he was doing. I gave one extra star because we still had fun despite it all. BIGBANG rocks! :)",2,0

With that said, I knew that going with this company for a bachelorette party was a bad idea, but went along with it for a close friend who wanted it this way. Despite the doubt, I went into the experience with an open mind especially since it was a first party bus experience. After being on this ""party tour"" for an hour, my fears of throwing $200 down the drain came true. Unkept promises, inadequate and unsafe transportation, and poor quality service was what was delivered. For $200 + tax, part of my group of 20 females were left to stand on the ""mix and mingle"" part of ""tour"" because they overbooked the bus and didn't have adequate space to accommodate, some weren't offered the contracted alcohol on the bus because they ran out, and we stood in 3 different lines to get in to the first club. Party Tours considers this VIP service. When we were not happy with our service, some of the girls tried to contact the manager. The manager hung up on the coordinator of the party and were unwilling to resolve our concerns. As a group of 20, we paid $4000+. We would've received so much more had we booked our own tables and bottle service. Please do not spend your money here. You will encounter nothing but frustration and disappointment.",1,0

Party Tours,"Event Planning & Services, Nightlife, Dance Clubs, Party Bus Rentals, Tours, Limos, Bus Tours, Bars, Transportation, Club Crawl, Hotels & Travel","My review will echo most of what's been said on prior reviews, but I think it's important for people to know that some of the complaints are still occurring. Got on 1 of their party buses last night. Living in California, I go to Vegas pretty often and have been to pretty much every club. Had some friends visiting that were visiting Vegas for the first time and thought this would be a good way for them to experience more than 1 club and take a ride on a limo bus. Here are the pro/cons of my experience: Pros -entrance into 3 different night clubs with no cover charge (LAX, Chateau, PURE). This is especially nice for guys who will pay $30-50 admission and stand in a long line. -transportation between the clubs Cons -They base the amount of seats they sell on the legal max amount of people allowed on the bus by law, not the actual amount of people that will fit. We aren't all Abercrombie models and people come in all shapes and sizes. They arrange the buses to have 50/50 guys versus girls to keep the nightclubs happy on the G to G ratio. They have to know that guys will take up more room and should have accounted for that. My bus was overbooked and not everybody had a seat. We were assured after going to the first club that they would move people around to other buses so that everyone would have a seat for the rest of the night. This was never fixed and 4 people were forced to stand the entire night. -The process of getting everyone from the bus to the club entrances was slow and unorganized. We were only able to go to the first 2 clubs for less than an hour because of the delays getting to the door. The wait to get in to the clubs was fine, but only having 1 host to escort 20+ people through a casino was not efficient. There was a lot of standing around waiting for people to catch up/use restrooms since we all had to go in to the club together. -The website said there was supposed to be someone taking pictures all night and we could retrieve the photos from their website. This did not happen at all. -The website says that the bus was supposed to be stocked with unlimited Skyy Vodka, Captain Morgen, beer, and several mixers. There was some, but there wasn't enough to go around and they were rationing how much they were handing out. We passed a jug of cranberry juice down to the end of the bus for someone who needed it and the host took the jug and returned it back to the front. It just didn't feel like they knew how to treat customers. I will say that I got my money's worth because we were given entrance into 3 different clubs, but the overall experience from a hospitality standpoint was poor, unorganized, and understaffed. I've visited Vegas numerous times and I was happy to get into 3 clubs in 1 night, but if you're thinking of booking this for yourself or friends new to Vegas, I would not recommend it. Hospitality is everything, especially when there's plenty of other companies in LV that do this sort of thing. It seems like the company has been in business for a while and I would have expected all these problems be fixed over time.",2,0

I have to admit I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews. The itinerary had changed since I booked the groupon. We started at Hard Rock bar, then on to 1-Oak, then Body English, then Pure. There was never a wait at any of the clubs, we walked right in. They made it clear when to meet back and the bus was always ready. The bus is really nice, large space, and fun party music. There was plenty of beer, Skyy Vodka, and Captain Morgans. Drinks were strong and endless. Matt did a great job of corralling a bunch of drunk people. They have you repeat back the time to meet so you don't forget - smart! For 3 clubs and endless drinks on the bus the groupon was a great deal. They even stop at the Las Vegas sign for a few minutes and pictures. I was a little bummed when a girl dumbed her full cup cranberry vodka on my shoes and legs but the staff were prompt with napkins. Thanks Matt!",4,1

We get to the first destination cabo wabo we have some drinks while waiting for our next destination. The host tells is we are ready to go. Great I am thinking we will finally get on the party bus for some free drinks.. Well to my surprise that's not the case we walk across the way to a club in the same spot we already are. Still no party bus still none of the free drinks they rave about. The host walks us in and tells Us to meet again at 12:10. 12 comes so we go to the meeting spot.. 12:10,12;15,12.20 still sitting there. Finally 12:30 comes and they tell us to go downstairs so we do 12:45 and still no party bus. The host had told us the tour would be over at 2. How is it we would have time to go to Vegas sign and still 2-3 more clubs in an hour and 15 min. We decided forget it and left, 3 hour in to this tour we have yet to leave the original place we started and never once stepped Into a party bus and never once had a free drink.

I don't like to write reviews unless they're golf related but I just have to make an exception here and do the public a service. Got the Rock Star Party Tour from Groupon for $60 myself and three friends. Thought it was a good deal cos the original price was like $160 each on their website. Big mistake! What a rip off! It was just lame from start to finish. Met up with the tour group at the Luxor Cathouse for 2-for-1 drinks specials and immediately got pressured left and right to upgrade to an open bar for an extra $20 each. They just wouldn't take no for an answer and wouldn't let us in until we explained to them why we didn't want to upgrade. WFT?! We sat in our own little roped off section for an hour to wait for the rest of the group to check in. During that time, not a single wait staff came over to ask if we wanted a drink. Huh?? Finally got on the party bus but it was just as lame even with an open bar cos they rationed the beer and liquor out of a Coleman cooler, literally! The music was horrible cos the clueless host was DJ'ing it - turning if off and on while he made endless announcements and dry jokes. The 2-hour ride made stops at the Fremont light show, Las Vegas welcome sign for photos, then finally at 1-Oak in the Mirage to go clubbing. The club itself was fine but what VIP passes? The VIP line was literally 3 times as long as the regular line cos everybody from the different ""VIP"" buses were arriving at the same time so we waited in line for 15mins while the regulars got thru in 5mins. What a friggin' joke!! Felt completely scammed knowing that their profit margin running this gig is huge. Cheap and limited booze and beers, kick-backs for bringing us into the clubs, stopping only at free show venues, etc. If it's your first time in Vegas straight outta high school then you might think that this tour is OK but make sure to pay no more than $40 for it.",1,0
Payless Car Rental,"Car Rental, Hotels & Travel",These guys suck. We went through a $1.50 toll leaving Pittsburgh. Was told by a phone rep that now we will be charged $3.99 a day every day for three weeks even though that was the only toll we drove through - to get out of airport and go north on 376. I asked to speak to a supervisor. She disconnected me. Pay more at Payless. Now that is bs. Never again. Boooooooooo. We called a second rep who gave a different story. He said we'd be charged $17 plus toll every time we drive a toll road. Not much better. Good-bye Payless. We are frequent car renters.,1,0
Payless Car Rental,"Car Rental, Hotels & Travel","I have been trying to resolve an issue with the Payless Rental Car Company at the Pittsburgh International Airport.

I accepted one of the very few cars that was available, but the price was much higher than my reservation. When I returned the next day, I stopped by the Payless counter where the agent told me I would be reimbursed the difference within a couple of weeks. I even had the agent put this in writing. I have been trying to get my issue resolved for these three months, but I have been ignored. I have called the agent, assistant manager, manager and district manger, and I have filled out a Payless on-line service ticket, all without a response.

However it is evident that Pay less does not care about customer service as the lady in front of me started arguing with the desk agent asking why it took so long-He told her that ""you can always use the other rental agencies if you want to"":which at this stage had nobody waiting in line- ""a take it or leave it and see if I care"" attitude...wow. I decided to be nice to him when it was my turn as I just wanted to get a care and be gone,again no apology for the almost one hour wait in line very poor service -when I travel on business I use Avis and am a preferred member while a little more expensive that Pay less-their customer service is fantastic and clearly they value their customers",1,0

Payless Car Rental,"Car Rental, Hotels & Travel","On Monday, June 17, The Payless outlet at the Pittsburgh airport sent me on my way with a vehicle that announced a slow leak in one tire two hours down the interstate. On arrival at my destination, I phoned Payless, and a woman offered to have the vehicle towed and repaired. She neglected to tell me I would have to pay for that. I opted to see how the leak progressed. It continued to lose air, and I filled it daily. The day before my return, June 19, at 5.33 pm I spoke to a manager at Payless who mumbled his name, and told me that he didn't have to do anything about my problem because a) I had done a walk around inspection and failed to spot the leak; b) I had declined the ""roadside assistance"" package, which I guess is an extra gouge to get Payless to act like a responsible rental agency; and c) I had declined the offer of a tow at the end of the first day (from the woman who neglected to tell me I would have to pay for it). When I asked him to repeat his name, he said he wouldn't. The car made it back to the airport on Thursday, June 20, and when I turned it in I reported the leaking tire to the attendant. Holly Wright of the Payless Pittsburgh office and I spoke on June 27. She said that in return for bringing the problem to their attention she was going to bill my credit card $190 to replace the tire. A ""piece of metal"" had been discovered in the sidewall, which made it beyond repair. Her proof that the metal had not been in the tire when I acquired the vehicle was the fact that no prior customers of that vehicle had reported anything. But why would they if they knew they would get the bill for the tire if they spoke up (as I did)? Holly suggested she was doing me a big favor by waiving some administrative fee, and the loss of rental income during the tire repair. She cheerfully pointed out I could contest the charge to my card, and then threatened to slander my credit rating by sending the matter to a collection agency if I did. Payless at the Pittsburgh Airport is collection of gangsters.

I also like that the parking in the economy lot is fairly inexpensive, and both times I have parked long-term I have come back to find my car in exactly the same shape I left it in. The shuttle is also very efficient, I have never had to wait more than 7-8 minutes to catch one to the economy lot and it is very easy to get in/out of the lot. (Just remember where you parked...)",4,1
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports","I have tried my best to like Mesa Gateway Airport, but today's trip is the last straw. TSA lines are insanely long even though I counted at least 20 ""agents"" milling around the security area & there were only 4 flights for the entire day. TSA pre check seemed to mean nothing to them as passengers were required to do everything that you are in the standard line. Gate agents are so unsocial it is painful. Frankly, I am willing to pay a little more to fly out of PHX to not have to deal with the incompetent staff & lengthy time spent in this airport.",1,0
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports","First time flying out of this airport, it's quiet. But staff is not helpful by any means. There were long lines however I got lucky because my line to check in was a lot shorter than the other lines. Customer service Is poor. A lady came from another line, cut me off and the clerk took her before me. I said ""excuse me I was next"" the clerk said ""no it's ok"" and I replied back with ""no it's not"" and she continued to help the other lady. I patiently waited for my turn and got the same clerk that took the person that cut me off. I told her, next time she should tell the person that cuts people off that there are separate lines because that was not Ok! She continued to help me without even acknowledging what I told her. I needed a boarding pass and she said it would be $5 I told her I will not pay that. She than said I can download the app to avoid paying the cost and that is exactly what I did. I went straight to security and of course hit more long lines! Once finally checked in I rushed to my Gate and waited patiently for my flight to board. As I was sat in my seat, the flight attendant proceeds to tell everyone on the plane to get off because we do not have a pilot. Now I'm stuck in Arizona for how long ... I don't know!!! UPDATE: my flight was canceled !!!!!!! This airline is only good for cheap air fare. But honestly, I would pay an extra dollar for peace of mind. They have a long way to go when it comes to customer service and the lines are ridiculous. Now I know why they want you to arrive at the airport two hours before your flight !!",2,0
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports","I would NEVER in forever use this airport again. Have a very limited number of flights not to mention planes. In the event one has a ""mechanical"" issue they have no others to sub out. Probably an Allegient issue. At the current time 3 flights are waiting on their baggage! Our flight has been waiting an hour and 1/2. They have the slowest service in history of airport service. Sorry, never using this airport or carrier again!",1,0
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports","Just flew out of here for the first time, and it was a nice change of pace from the larger airports. It's clean, well-organized, parking is close by (albeit pricey - $11/day). There are a few restaurants and gift shops inside (though the Paradise Bakery is terribly slow and understaffed). Seating by the gate areas was plentiful. No ridiculous crowds. I'll take it!",4,1

Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports","If my grandparents ran an airport it would be this one. This is a very small and dated airport, but what it lacks in size and technology it's makes up for in charm and cleanliness. The staff here are extremely friendly and willing to help you get from point A to B, even if that trek is only twenty feet. There are ten small gates in this airport and the snacking spots are minimal. So if you're looking to grab that Starbucks or Cinnabon before you depart, sorry my friend, no major corporations have infiltrated this airport... Yet. They seem to keep it stocked with some local premade snacks and beverages. I kinda dig that no corpo feel. There is one eatery here called the Copper Plate that sells burgers and shakes. So if that Zonie enduced hangover has you sweating vodka bullets, belly up to the bar and get your carb on. Great place, cozy feel, and the like mentioned, solid customer service. The next time I book my flight to the Grand Canyon State, I'll try to fly through the Gateway. Peace!",4,1

Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports","I don't usually write reviews on airports but I have flown in and out of Mesa-Gateway a few time.

So much easier, especially if you are not checking in luggage, it's a breath of fresh air! Not much options for food, but with no waits what do you need food for?.lol.but if you do need food there is a restaurant there and a snack shop.",4,1
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports",Absolutely horrible! The airport is not equipped to handle the amount of traffic they have! The buildings are packed and the security area is a mess--the line literally went out the door!

And the actual gates don't even have enough seating! Ridiculous!,1,0
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports","You know what? This airport isn't so bad! I was flying on standby out of the airport and knew there was a good chance that I'd be there for a few hours and I didn't mind. I reviewed the selection of restaurants and found them intriguing and they also have free WiFi. Who doesn't love that amenity when going through the ""hurry up and wait"" routine at the airport. We went through security at what I'd think is a prime time of the morning and had zero difficulties - we probably got through in less than five minutes. The restrooms I entered were clean, all of the escalators and moving walkways were functioning, and I ended up making my flight. All in all, this is was a pleasurable experience and I wouldn't mind having a layover or stay in Phoenix again.",4,1
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports","Small airports make me happy. They're easier to get to, quieter, and less frantic than monster airports like Sky Harbor that feel like giant beehives on speed. When I travel, I want to relax, people-watch, and reflect on life. I love this airport. The ticket agents and store clerks are always friendly; during my recent trip, a very nice shop clerk let me buy a souvenir even though I was almost a dollar short for it. The security folks are relaxed and good humoured... unheard of in Canada! After waltzing through security, you walk down a short hallway to an excellent bakery/cafe, convenience/souvenir shops, and a full service restaurant with outdoor patio. Yes, outdoor! Heavens to Betsy! The patio is part of a small fenced in park, with cafe tables and chairs in the sun and the shade, a beautiful cactus garden, lots of stone benches, trees, and a sloping lawn of thick soft grass to lay on and look at the sky. But best of all, at Gateway you board your plane the old fashioned way, feeling like you're in a 1940's movie: walking across the tarmac, climbing the staircase, with the wind rustling your dress and blowing your scarf over your shoulder as you glance back at your despairing lover. It's all so very romantic.",5,1
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports","This airport is the worst. It is a long drive to get there unless you live in east Mesa. It is very unorganized and checking in is usually a nightmare. We have flown out of this airport using Allegiant Air many times and we will not do it again. The flights are cheap, but they nickel and dime you to death so by the time you pay for everything it's probably not much cheaper than using a real airline. Allegiant is even charging for carry on bags now. Save yourself the huge headache and fly out of Sky Harbor.",1,0
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports","Most awesome little airport!! I feel like I got in and out almost too quickly.. would have loved to lie on the grass and read. Security line was short and my planes were on time. 3 main buildings 6 gates 2 food options 1 baggage conveyor belt Parking is right outside, and you have to walk from the airplane to the gate. Simple, clean, and efficient.... perhaps what the SJ Mineta was many moons ago.",5,1
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports","Flew in and out of there recently on Allegiant air. They offered a nonstop to Springfiled Mo, and I was going to Branson for a week, (Yes, I am a hick). I used to work out in this area, so I know where it is, and it is very easy to get too. Went to the parking lot by the airport, and it was full, so had to go to the satellite lot, which took some time. But the shuttle was right there when I got to the parking lot, and right outside door number 5 when I got back, which was nice. Didn't eat, so don't know what the food was like. Normally, I would give this a 4 star review, as it is convenient, good parking. etc. The reason I knocked it down a star is that Allegiant (on top of charging you for looking at them) doesn't provide kiosks, so you have to wait in line, and there were long lines for lots of flights, and only 3 people working the ticket counter. I was concerned I might miss my flight. I didn't, but thought I might. They preboarded me and my daugher (she has down syndrome) which was nice. All in all, a very pleasant experience. Though I still like Sky Harbor better.",3,0

Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport,"Hotels & Travel, Airports","The airport is great. The airlines suck. But since this is a review for the airport itself, I'll ignore how terrible, terrible the tenants are. The facility itself is nice. It's small and made up of several buildings. It's not particularly close to town, but it's not that far away, and if you need to fly out of here, it's not inconvenient, and traffic to and from is very light. There is a pretty good restaurant and bar on site with good grub and affordable prices, and there are the usual airport shops. The best part is the outdoor area (weird for an airport - I know). There is a sort of courtyard between all the buildings, and considering the usual pleasantness of Phoenix weather, it's a nice relaxing place to sit while waiting for a flight. It beats sitting in a terminal! Oh, and they have free wi-fi, so you can stream movies to your computer or phone, which is especially nice since cellular service sucks out that far (at least on AT&T). Because of the size, security is a breeze. On-site parking is very close. You could park, walk to the terminal, and get through security in 10 minutes (though you should always get to an airport early). Parking is cheap. Not much more to say about that. OH, BONUS TIP! If you go to school at ASU or work at ASU and have an ASU parking permit, this airport is right next to the Polytechnic Campus. Like right next to campus. Most ASU permits have reciprocal parking privileges at the Polytechnic Campus, so check to see if yours does. If you can park there (which almost anyone with an ASU permit can), you can park on campus and walk an extra five minutes. BAM! Free parking! Yeah, the parking at the airport is only $8 a day, but if you're gone for a week, save yourself $50 by walking five minutes.",4,1

The place stinks from skunks because there is garbage left out as the ""management"" can't seem to be able to negotiate a waste management contract and there are only pickups twice a week, with a two bag limit. Last night we went to a show here and they had 480 seniors packed in the ballroom with no air conditioning on a 88 F degree day. This place is run like a mom and pop shop but they charge big prices for everything. The noise from the air force jets is really loud as they're so low when the pass over, sometimes all day long. Sites are dirt/gravel with full hookups WAY in the back of the site. You may require extra hoses for water and sewer. Some sites have a concrete patio and some also have a concrete pad for your vehicle, but there seems to be no standard. Premium sites also have an 6 x 6 piece of fake grass in front and a concrete patio table, and what the front desk people warn is really slow wifi. Common areas are nice, bathroom showers need updating, and I would make top down changes in the management. RV'ers are an afterthought and their only focus is on selling vastly overpriced mobile homes. I really can't recommend this park for anything more than an overnight stay.",1,0

Had a tee time of 1:55 for 2 players, checked in at 1:40 and the gentleman told us to go ahead and head to tee #1 and start. Very nice and friendly. got to the tee and there was already a wait, a group in the fairway and on the green. after a 10min wait we got started, but after each shot had to wait until the group in front of us moved on, this was the normal routine for the entire round. at the third hole the group behind us caught us at the tee box and asked what are tee time was, told them 1:55, they were mildly upset due to they had a time ahead of ours, we explained to them that the gentleman in the pro shop told us to get started. They were fine with it just curious. After short conversation we discovered that the course sets tee times 7min apart, this is insane and would explain the massive wait at each hole. And this was a weekday afternoon, not even a weekend. Tee times should be 10-11min. As we moved along with our round trying to make the best of it, we were approaching the 18th green, time was 5:50, which considering the consistent waiting throughout the day was pretty good time to about have the round completed. A gentleman who appeared to be a grounds keeper came to us in a cart as we were walking to the green and informed us that there is a $25 fee for turning golf carts in after 5:30. We explained to him when we started and the constant wait and he said that is the rules and that the club house closes around 2-3. First issue is We paid for 18 holes of golf, it stays light until 6:30-6:45. Why would you even attempt to collect a ridiculous charge like this.

My other bitch is the garbage service, there is only 2 days a week for garbage pickup and that's it. There is no dumpster or cans to take your garbage to anywhere in the park, and they let you know that. Plus you cannot have any bags outside period.

Pueblo El Mirage RV Resort - Roberts Resorts,"Party & Event Planning, Restaurants, Event Planning & Services, RV Parks, Vacation Rentals, Golf, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces, Active Life",We went to the Pueblo El Mirage Country Club for dinner the other night with a group of 11. Our friend was celebrating a birthday and wanted to enjoy the fish fry. The facility is nice and I can see it being transformed into a very elegant location for a wedding. There are loads of tables and booths in the club. The food was good enough. Nothing special. The Fish Fry is an all-you-can-eat fry and they do offer baked fish as well along with a choice of regular or sweet potato french fries. You also get a cup of coleslaw. The fish was largely portioned and the sweet potato fries were yummy. The coleslaw was very bland though. Service is very slow here at the club though and that's what is keeping me from being terribly excited about it. We waited almost 30 minutes from the time of ordering for us to receive our appetizers and that's really not acceptable. The place was busy but I got the feeling that the wait staff just isn't trained well on time management skills. Our server did try his best and tried to get with the program but just couldn't seem to get his ducks in a row. I will go back as the food was good and my husband and son are eager to give the golf course a whirl. Hopefully the service will improve soon!,3,0

I didn't get a chance to check out the pool or workout room, but I saw a glimpse and they looked really nice and clean as well. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. I just wish they had a bigger business center and not be right in the middle of the lobby. But that didn't even bother me. They had a microwave in the room, and a fridge which was great cause when I had left over room I got to keep it nice a cool and warm it up. Staff were super nice!

Radisson Hotel,"Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","I did not enjoy my stay here, as a business traveler expecting a reasonably nice hotel. The hotel felt shabby, and the parking lot did not feel safe. I took ALL my luggage inside to guard against theft. The room itself had a big scratch on the closet door, the hook on the bathroom was bolted on, lopsided, with some weird kind of bolt. The room was stiflingly hot, but there was a note by the thermostat to the effect that in the winter you would only get heat from the unit, so leave it off if you want it cooler.

Radisson Hotel,"Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","This place was like a second home for us until we moved to Toronto. We stayed weeks and months from August 2013 until Jan 2016. Few things about this place... It is not 4/5 star hotel, it is a 3 star hotel, not pricey for 3 star hotel, but good compared to any 3 star hotel in Toronto. For us there not be any better location to stay, as our office was 200 meters from hotel. The best part of the chain is their reward program (club Carlson), much better and useful then any other reward program. We have tried SPG, Marriott, Hilton, as well, but we would not use any of the rewards. We have used Radisson rewards for stay in Europe and India. They have great loyalty programme. My initial few stays were not pleasant, as hotel was under renovation. But then it grew on us (me and my hubby). The staff is great, friendly & helpful. Radisson believes in customer retention so they kept us happy by giving us lil surprise from time to time. Over the period of 3 years they have really improved their rooms, and facilities. While booking make sure to get parking included, if you have a car, as otherwise parking is 7 $ per night and they wont include it after booking. For us due to company special pricing, we always had it for free. Once I had to stay for a personal trip and I did not asked for the free parking in advance (I assumed it will be free, as I had a habit of not paying for it :P ) and they wont make adjustment to it :( Their breakfast buffet is not good just basic, if you are paying for it. We had it included, but we still skipped it many times. Fruits are not fresh. But the butler will is very delightful person and he would remember you, your food likes and dislikes. Even your favourite table and would reserve for you if you are staying there for longer duration. He would pour me coffee, without asking, he knew it. For my husband, he would confirm for eggs- sunny side up and make it quick, as he would always remember that my hubby is always in hurry. lol As our stays were frequent, we got upgraded rooms/services/ toiletries and facilities. We took their taxi service 2 times to airport and we got a drop in a LIMO with regular cost of 50$ wow!!! We would get surprise gift hampers in our room !!",4,1
Radisson Hotel,"Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","Don't stay here. The phone kept ringing in the hallway in the middle of the night. Weird right? Disturbing me from my sleep i went downstairs to tell the staff on duty, only to be told to just hang up the phone. I did it and the phone would still keep going off, so i went outside again to leave it off the hook. Staff doesn't care when you complain. The AC is loud. There was a leak in the washroom. It was not clean. I got allergies in the room. The bed was uncomfy, it was some machine where you can adjust the firmness, but mine was not working. The line to complain was long. Manager would give you a time to meet to speak of the problem only to Not show up TWICE! He was rude when I finally got to speak with him, not an appointment like we discussed apparently you have to hunt this guy down or something. He made it sound like the hotel has no fault and there's nothing he can do. Just terrible. He said the problem was fixed and made it seem like I would return to a wonderful surprise... I guess the washroom floor wasn't all wet from the leak but that was basically it. This is review from November 2015. Just remembered to write this review after staying at an awesome Holiday Inn Express and I am shocked at the difference. No more Radisson Hotel, way to represent Radisson North York.",1,0
Radisson Hotel,"Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","If I could put a negative star review I would. I am currently staying here on a business trip and this will definitely be my last. Upon walking into the hotel it looks like it is possibly a hostel or refugee camp. I travel very often for work and the first thing that I always do is check the beds. When I did this, I found random hairs. I tossed these pillows aside and attempted to forget and go to bed. The bed is so rock hard that my back was in intense pain. I woke up so many times because of how uncomfortable the bed was. Around 2am I got up and realized that behind the bed was some kind of machine. It turns out the bed is a Sleep Number (never mentioned upon checkin and it was covered by the sheets). After putting the number to the lowest possible number it was better but not great. There are water stains on the ceiling in the bathroom and the room smells like cigarettes (I am in a non smoking room). Found more random hairs in the shower.

Radisson Hotel,"Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","This place is just terrible. When I got there, they put me in the wrong room. I had booked a non-smoking room for 4 people and ended up on a smoking room with a single king bed. I brought this to their attention and they took over an hour to fix it. In fact, I had to get a little upset in front of other customers so they would take care of me. The long faces of everyone else in the lobby said it all. The place was understaffed and I could even hear the conversations between the maintenance guy and the front desk about the issues with the rooms and the fact he just couldn't get to them all on time. On top of that, they charge daily for parking, something not mentioned anywhere when making a reservation. At least I didn't see it. The lobby had a broken tile with a leak on the roof and a bucket catching the water. Other customers were whispering about how everyone was complaining about the place. At least the lady who took care of the room thing was nice enough to give me breakfast vouchers. The people at breakfast were awesome, especially the waiter. My room bathtub's paint was peeling off. The toilet was clogging. I killed a centipede in there too (thank god my kids didn't see this). This was a room for four and I barely got one tiny little cheap shampoo and soap bottle. The sofa bed was so uneven I would have slept better in the floor. When we came back from on the afternoon, the room seemed somewhat clean, but nowhere as neat as one would expect after service. The air conditioning was so loud that my wife asked me to turn it off because she couldn't sleep. The pool water was somewhat dirty and it smelled in some areas of the pool. You could smell the chlorine all the way to the lobby. I guess bombarding it with chemicals is cheaper than actually filtering or cycling the water. The employee that helped me check out was the only person genuinely interested on making me feel better. She asked about my stay and I didn't even want to get into details. She gave me a nice discount on the parking and stay which I appreciated immensely after all the trouble, only to realize that in her quest to make me happy, she forgot to take the room cards from the counter. I guess I must have pocketed them with the rest of my stuff during the conversation, so now I will probably get charged on my card for those things, to add to my misery, something other customers have complained about in other reviews I read. No way in hell I am going back to that place, EVER.",1,0
Radisson Hotel,"Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","Definitely not up to par considering they charge the same amount as a normal Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn. First of all, the first room they gave me was on the 9th floor (even though I requested a lower floor when booking) and the lady at the front desk gave me Room 911. Normally that fact wouldn't have bothered me, but she actually BROUGHT UP the fact that it was weird I got room 911 and tried to make a joke about it! I had to explain that joking about 911 is NOT FUNNY to any American. It might have been me but I got really freaked out and ended up changing rooms. However, regardless of my insensitive experience with the front desk staff, I got to the room and the ceiling tiles were stained, and really just looked really run down. Ended up changing rooms (to a lower floor as well) and it was a little better looks wise but it does vaguely smell like smoke and the volume on the TV is broken. Not awesome. The bar/restaurant downstairs has a very limited menu and is nothing to say much about. The charge $8 a day for parking (I have never been to a hotel that charges for parking!) which is ridiculous because there is a bunch of room in parking lot anyway. Overall, although it looks like they tried to make some updates to this place it gives off a dark and creepy vibe with a bad restaurant (and not much around to go elsewhere) with at least one insensitive staff member and cold lighting. I'll be telling my company never to book here again. UPDATE: The shower in my room has not been cleaned! I counted at least a dozen hairs plus a couple streaks of blue soap on the wall of the shower. Gross.",1,0

We were upgraded to a suite as we were travelling with our puppy. Love that the hotel is pet friendly! The hotel is due for an upgrade/renovation as the room needed some work and so did the furnishings in the public areas.

Radisson Hotel,"Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","As someone who travels for business half of the year and stays everywhere from trendy boutique hotels to econo hotels, I am pretty fair in my reviews. I am also confident in saying that this was an awful, awful experience. The Radisson is located near absolutely nothing. No restaurants, no salons, no stores - just a bunch of corporate offices, right off the highway. At night it was really dark. So if you are traveling for business and need to get a manicure, or have something mailed/fedex/printed out or even just sit down for dinner at a nearby restaurant - you are screwed. The whole thing was creepy but I powered on, as it was near midnight and I was tired from a cross country flight. When I first arrived to the hotel, the man at the front desk was asleep and snoring loudly; I am talking mouth open, head tipped back, snoring. He awoke to check me in and I inquired about room service or mini-bar and was promptly informed they had neither, not even a mini-mart, and the kitchen wouldn't open until breakfast, but that he had a number for pizza delivery if I wanted to call. Again, NO amenities. The decor was older, like mid-90s business-y, and it smelled like deodorizer and just all around depressing! No wireless and internet was around 17 bucks - too much for slower internet! Also, I found the random horse statue on my desk totally weird. The hotel room itself smelled like mold or chemical air spray that was sprayed to cover the scent of mold, carpet was ugly and smelled like chemical cleaners, my bathtub faucet leaked all night, the thermostat went on and off and the stupid comfort bed remotes they had, that allowed you to adjust the firmness of your mattress, didnt work. Like literally neither of them would click softer or firmer, the remotes for them were broken and wouldnt work. Mattress was hard and felt run down. Ive stayed in many Radissons and know how to use these remotes so it wasnt me, it was 100 percent broken. One bed remote didnt turn on and the other one didnt adjust. I complained to management, who told me they would take a look into it, but alas, nothing changed and I was not offered any discounts either for this issue. The ""restaurant"" was a bunch of prefabricated wood tables with chairs and a buffet. I only could stomach breakfast, as the food looked gross and I was eating with clients at night so there was no need to try dinner. The breakfast was over priced as it was $14 for generic cereals, greasy bacon and watery, thin cream of wheat style porridge. Eggs were watery, bland. An older company complained to the chef, who was putting in more eggs, and he snapped at them and told them to complain to their waitress as he ""didn't have time for this"". This hotel is NOT worth it and continues to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed at whilst in the Toronto area.",1,0
Radisson Hotel,"Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","Honestly, one of the worst hotel experiences of my life. Stayed here with multiple fellow colleagues this past week and it was nothing but problem after problem. To begin, any floor between 1-4 wreaks of mold, mildew, and stale cigarette smoke. Even better is the smell of pot depending on the time of day. Their next issue is the fact that upon check-in I was not made aware of the fact that the pool has been out for two weeks and there is still no ETA of when it will be fixed. Also, their A/C went out in the entire building and they tried to pretend it was an isolated incident. Their hotel bar/lounge is a hole in the wall with glassware that had not been cleaned to standard. My water glass had a ring in it about 2"" up and after seeing that in the water glass, I was afraid to drink my glass of coke. There was also a vomit spill just outside the 7th floor elevator doors, giant stains on the carpets in rooms, an flooding due to poor floor design. I could share even more of this frightfully bad stay, but I think this is enough to keep you far away. The good news is... If you get a room on the 8th or 9th floor, you get a useless horse statue on your desk.",1,0

Residence Inn Madison East,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","I love Residence Inn. This one has quiet, comfortable rooms and excellent housekeeping. The staff were amazing and friendly! I am so accustomed to this at Marriott properties that I almost take it for granted and forget to mention it. This would be five stars except for three issues. First: the breakfast. It is fast and free, but I am not a fan of bagged eggs nor of steamed potatoes. This is standard fare for Residence Inn and most free breakfast hotels these days. Nevertheless, I do not find this acceptable food to start one's day. I deducted an half star for this. The second issue is a complaint that is becoming common to a lot of hotels and not particular to this property. The motion sensor or other controls that shut the AC off during the day and at night drive the temperature up to about 80 degrees even when set at 70 degrees (minimum setting here). I woke up each night in a sweat. This forced me to use housekeeping daily to get clean sheets as the sheets were drenched with sweat. I finally went to target and bought a personal fan which helped considerably. I understand trying to save resources and money, but I am considering avoiding properties that have these sort of controls. If I wanted balmy environments I would pitch a tent! Since I travel on business, the sweaty nights make for unrestful sleep. This does not make me want to stay here again despite all the positives. However, I only thought it worth one star deduction. The room was quiet, spacious, and comfortable but most certainly was NOT a suite. A suite has more than one room. This was a STUDIO. Since I was traveling alone this was not a problem, but the reservation was for a suite. Since I did not complain nor ask for a correction, I did not deduct from my review. However, if you have a reservation for a suite, you should expect a door between the bedroom and living area. Anything less is not a suite. Again, I did not deduct for this. The third and most critical issue that caused me to deduct a full star: the cooktop is not capable of boiling water. There are two five-inch (small) electric ""burners"" (hobs) on the cooktop. Neither of them will boil water in the large pot no matter how long you leave them on high. I ruined my pasta because it just turned into a clump of half-cooked, half-raw mess because of this. So this is NOT a full kitchen; only the microwave is usable. Since the free breakfast is not good and I cannot cook meals here, I question the value of this as a ""Residential Hotel"". Not what I am accustomed to at Residence Inn. So the review is 2.5 Stars rounded UP to three stars. I doubt I would stay at this location again. Considering I will be working in Madison for 6 more weeks over the rest of the year, that is a big deal. I will try the other Residence Inn only if they can assure me that the kitchen is usable. If I have to use just the microwave, then just about any hotel with fridge and microwave will suffice.",3,0
Residence Inn Madison East,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Based on the typical Residence Inn I was expecting an older and outdated property, but was pleasantly surprised when I got to my room. It appears that they have updated the rooms to a near full-service Marriott quality. I'll definitely be staying here the next time I'm in Madison.",4,1
Residence Inn Madison East,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","This hotel has recently been updated, and what a great change it is! The location is easy to get to, and it's far enough away from East Wash/151 that you don't get any noise from the traffic. The staff at the front desk was helpful. Housekeeping was accommodating of our later schedule. They will stop by your room and leave a note on your door if you don't answer, or if you're gone and leave your do not disturb sign up. The update is great, although they seemed to have skipped over the toilet/shower area. Which is fine by me, because all you really need them for is to your business and get on with your day. There's plenty of storage in the bathroom area. We stayed in a King Suite. There's a big, actually HUGE, sofa in the main living area, which we fell in love with. As for the rest of the room, it was very typical of most Residence Inns, full sized fridge, two burner cooktop, a table for two, and a big desk with enough work space. The breakfast was pretty typical of most Residence Inns. They offer a small dinner a few nights a week, which is what you'd expect from a hotel dinner, bland but familiar. I removed a star because of the parking situation. While this isn't the staffs fault, I can't imagine why someone would build a hotel without enough parking spaces to accommodate the guests in the rooms. They send their overflow parking across the street to Denny's. Which I don't trust, and I think that brings about a whole mess with liability if something were to happen... But overall the parking situation is just a big pain in the butt. There were numerous occasions when we just monitored the parking lot and moved our car back into their lot as soon as possible. That aside, I would probably stay here again and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",4,1
Residence Inn Madison East,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","4 stars for the service. 3.5 stars for the room and accomodations I usually wait to patronize at least two times before reviewing but the service was really nice and sweet to us. Went for a Bridal Shower and Bachelorette Party and the manager plus two staff members worked hard, fast and quick (in my eyes) to bring tables, chairs then remove tables, chairs. The room was nice enough. The wrap around sofa impressed a number of ladies. It sits low. The room was a suite set up with a LCD hanging from the wall in the common area and LCD on the dresser in the bedroom. Toilet and shower in one room. Sinks outisde the ""john"" across from sliding door closet. Kitchenette has a full size fridge, stove, microwave and sink BUT only a two top cooking stove. That's enough for you to get things done and barely burn down the entire building. The place is nicely appointed. The bed felt decent enough but I didn't get to sleep we partied to long. Of course, as this is WI, there's an indoor pool and hottub. Elevator. Numerous Handicap parking Sundires store. They are smart to put the best smelling Glade Plug in at the entry (ahhhh).",4,1

Scott Clark Toyota,"Auto Repair, Car Rental, Auto Parts & Supplies, Hotels & Travel, Used Car Dealers, Car Dealers, Automotive","Well I'll start by saying I bought a car here, not because of the service or anything other than it was a good price, the people that handled my sale weren't very personable or friendly, was told a couple times I would get a call back about the car because I had some questions about it, never got a call, was also told that car would be put in the garage so they wouldn't sell it while I traveled all the way there, I get there and the car is on the lot, the man helping me was busy with another customer which was fine and understandable but he could've got the credit sheet for my co signer to fill out while we were waiting on him, we already had Pre approval from a bank of my choice but they still ran credit through multiple other banks like Wells Fargo, sun trust, Toyota financial etc. which I'm not sure if that's something that's required or not was just annoying to have all those credit inquiries when I had a bank chosen... get the car back to Raleigh and noticed that the interior was not very clean, especially the windows on the inside of the car, I had to replace the wiper blades ASAP because the ones on the car were in horrible condition, I was told all the service was up to date on the car and it wouldn't need an oil change for 10k miles, the sticker in the car says the next service was due at 23k miles and the car only has 19k on it, another issue is an idle problem with the transmission, simple fix at any Toyota dealership that I'm stuck with fixing myself.....

Scott Clark Toyota,"Auto Repair, Car Rental, Auto Parts & Supplies, Hotels & Travel, Used Car Dealers, Car Dealers, Automotive","My boyfriend and I went in JUST TO LOOK at a car. We told each salesperson that approached us that we just wanted to look and had absolutely no intention of buying that day because we needed to compare. We apologized in advance and knew we did not want to waste anyone's time but we would not be buying under any circumstances. One salesman sat down with us to talk and was very friendly and personable. He took us to look at new cars and explained features and details. Great. He asked us if we wanted to test drive the car. Although we did not want to mislead him we agreed. We went for a short drive and then he assured us he understood we did not want to buy but asked if we would like to look at some numbers. Once again, we said yes but only if it wasn't wasting his time. We explained to him our concerns with my boyfriends financed car and that he would ultimately be trading his in but not for a while since at the moment he owed too much to make it worth the trade. The salesman said there was a possibility they would take the of the loan, but he would have to check to give us more a accurate quote. Some time later he brought over someone else who basically said the price we would want to pay is not going to happen. Which is fine because as we stressed so many other times we were not ready to buy anyway! This man was extremely rude as he would not look at me when I talked and told him AGAIN that we were not there to buy at that time. We quickly ended that conversation and left the dealership. I have a Toyota that I just finished paying off. I love the product. I don't really want to buy any other brand, but I will not be back to this dealership. I have been to this dealership for service. The first time I was here it was for an oil change etc. I know very little about cars. I got the service that the manager recommended ($300+) I'm sure I got duped somewhere along the line, but that's my own fault for trusting shifty car sales/service people. About a month after my car was serviced my boyfriend noticed oil leaking from my car on to the driveway. It turns out that when my oil was changed something was not tightened enough so all the oil was drained from my car and was completely bone dry. Of course we called and they filled the oil. We waited 45 minutes-1 hour in the service center for what I believe should have been a priority job and done in less than half that time-- since you know, they almost ruined my engine. At that time we were also approached by a lady asking if I was interested in trading in my car since there was such high demand for my model/year. Just no. Wrong time to approach someone when your team just almost ruined my car. Ok, that's enough to convince me to never go back to this dealership. I will find another in the area. Such a shame.",1,0

So, I went to Town & Country Toyota and was in and out with a 2014 Camry in about an hour. This would be a much better dealership if they would just ditch the cheap car sales techniques.

The worst thing is that they made mistakes on mis-quoting transferring plates vs. getting me a new one and then the purchase price vs sales price on two different documents was off by over $3K and the finance manager couldn't explain the difference! Then the entire process from walking in the door to test drive 2 vehicles, negotiating & then waiting for finance/paperwork seriously took 5 hrs! That's just CRAZY! We didn't leave the dealership until after 10pm on a Saturday! Low pressure salesperson who was nice but the length of time to get the paperwork done and signed is horrible plus the error in some of the numbers that I questioned...doesn't build confidence! We did return to get the corrected paperwork and they explained the 'systems' error of the $3K difference and filled our gas tank for making the trip back. Their computer system generates the two financial documents differently and it is a glitch. The bottom line net purchase price was correct on both forms, but I was alarmed to see other figures vary by $3+K! Had a reply to my review from Stuart, we spoke and he understood my concerns and said he'd follow up with the Sales Manager about my concerns and the fact that I was not given the all season mats as promised.

Scott Clark Toyota,"Auto Repair, Car Rental, Auto Parts & Supplies, Hotels & Travel, Used Car Dealers, Car Dealers, Automotive","""Scott Clark Toyota-Home of the Lifetime Warranty"" IS A SCAM!!!! DO NOT FALL FOR IT OR DEPEND ON IT! Let me tell you about their so called ""lifetime powertrain warranty."" So when the Scott Clark Toyota (SCT) service advisor told be that ""warranty claims are a pain in the ass,"" he meant to say ""warranty claims are a SHAM!"" So when SCT told me that the estimated cost to repair the rear differential would be over $1770 I went to my go to repair facility, Woodies in Uptown. On a side note, they did the job for $1000. Anyway, when they contacted the warranty company that SCT used when I bought the car, and filed all the necessary documents, it was denied. Wasco, in Atlanta GA is the company servicing the warranty. The reason they denied the claim as the warranty was invalid as I could not prove I did all the recommended services on my truck. Specifically I could not prove I rotated the tires!!!!! Really? What does that have to do with worn out rear pinion bearings. The Wasco rep told me that it had nothing to do with the wear, rather the warranty was invalid as I did not prove all the ""recommended"" service was accomplished. What a scam!!!! That has nothing to do with the worn part nor is that spelled out in the fine print on the warranty document. And, SCT never advised me to have all the recommended work done and documented. It is a proven fact that not rotating tires is not with the cost if you have to pay for it, and absolutely has no impact on any bearing in the driver train. SCT markets themselves as the ""home of the lifetime warranty."" The warranty company they use is unscrupulous and looks for any reason to split hairs and deny all claims. DO NOT BELIEVE THEM AS YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO USE THE WARRANTY. Obviously SCT does not give this to the auto buyer...it's worked into the price you pay for the car/truck. Don't fall for the scam as the warranty is worthless. I am referring SCT and Wasco to the BBB for action. On a positive note, Woodie's Auto in Uptown Charlotte and most specifically Asst Mgr Patrick are TOP SHELF!!!! I will never take my truck to anyone else...ever. Honest, dependable and trustworthy!

The truck had many problems that needed to be fixed for example needed new tires, tire sensors, etc. They put new tires on the truck but now the truck needs to be aligned just as every car that has new tires installed. Truck is pulling to the left very bad so I call scott clark now 3 days in a row and speak to my salesman Larry and he explains to that the dealer already lost money replacing tires and he will see if they can align it but probably not. So I've called him 3 times and talked to him 3 times and he has yet to call me back. So I'm driving a 2015 tacoma from Scott clark that I paid nearly 40k for and I already have to take it and spend 150 to get it aligned. I've only had it for 2 weeks.

Scott Clark Toyota,"Auto Repair, Car Rental, Auto Parts & Supplies, Hotels & Travel, Used Car Dealers, Car Dealers, Automotive","If I could rate negative stars, Scott Clark Toyota would deserve them. Looking to buy last year's model. Lots of great manufacturers discounts and incentives to buy 2013 models. Like many other postings, the business dealings turned out to be unethical. The word of my salesperson and several contacts were all untrustworthy. We made a deal for $30,000, only 3300 off of MSRP, for a 2013 dark gray Toyota Prius 4. (W/ sunroof and JBL). This coupled with Toyotas 0%/72 mos was a deal I could live with. (The funny part was they said the owner had to approve this low price. of course, I just laughed that off. Seriously, Scott wants to be involved in the deal for a 2013 Prius?) I have them run my credit and get the paperwork ready. They swear its illegal to fax or pdf a car contract and everything must be reviewed in their showroom. While we realized this is another white lie, we agree to a late night appointment so both of us can be there to be sure the paperwork is right. (Given some other experiences below, it sounds like paperwork with them has a history of scamming too). This appointment was scheduled at /near closing and our sales guy said that worked great for him because he needed our sale to count for January and it was 1/31. On our way down to the dealership he texts a picture of the dark gray prius ready to go. We confirm we are headed down to pick it up. Not more than a few minutes later he calls to tell me the prius was sold to another woman and that they found the same car in GA they will transport up on 2/1 and sell it to me for the same price. They just needed a copy of my driver's license. I told him all of that information was in my application and asked why wouldn't the other woman get the Prius coming up from GA? He said he needed the picture and never responded to the second question except to repeat it was sold. 30 min later I get another text from the sales guy saying the car a lady was buying was sold earlier in the night because there was no money in house and he was trying to sell her another one (clearly the text was not meant for me) on the lot. Then I get another call and the voice message is from the sales guy. He tells me about a similar car he has on the lot, they will give me a much more aggressive, better price, and i should come get it tonight (its after 900 pm at this point). I texted back, no thank you and that the car I was willing to buy needed to be the same as the one he sold out from under our agreements. 2/2 and still no prius, no further contact. 2/3 contacted them and there is no car, they cant reach the GA dealership, and they are still trying to sell me the white one. 2/7 finally contacted us with ""same deal"" on 2014 model that they couldn't show the invoice on. they said they could show a similar invoice. turns out this replacement was similar (not exact) to one they sold out from under us and it was sitting on the lot the whole time and worst of all no 0%/72 mos. A repeated contact came to tell us we can pick up car 2/10 with no apology, no admittance that this is not the same deal. Okay, then when we reject the ""same deal"" offer, two weeks later they send a form letter now telling us our credits not acceptable (huh!???) Dishonesty. Poor business practices. Dishonorable.

At first, I was impressed with their large selection of vehicles to choose from. After I purchased my new Prius, I was very pleased especially with Mr. Rucker and the sales team, however, the trouble began almost a week after I purchased my car with the finance department. I got a call from Mike in finance to ask about my husband's car loan we had with SETF. He told me that because of of that loan, the bank wanted to take back the o% on my new car unless we pay off the remaining balance on my husband's car (we only had four payments left on it). As I finance manager, when a credit check is run, the bank should have that information already. Why wait almost a week to go back and tell me the loan I was approved for at 0% is off the table? My husband and I paid off his car because we were told by Scott Clark we'd lose our interest free terms of the loan. The other problem came almost three weeks later when I noticed my 30 day tags were about to expire. When I purchased the car, the dealership said my plate would be mailed to me. When I called the DMV to inquire about my license plate, there was no record of my new car in the system. The DMV told me to contact Scott Clark. I called only to find out my license plate had been there for two weeks! No one bothered to mail them or call me with the option to pick them up!

Scott Clark Toyota,"Auto Repair, Car Rental, Auto Parts & Supplies, Hotels & Travel, Used Car Dealers, Car Dealers, Automotive","I went to this dealer to buy a specific car, however I was steered into another car that was cheaper and told was comparable. It was not. I was sold an extended warranty and then lied to about the terms and how it would be financed. Long story short, they took the money I would have paid for a quality car and coerced me into buying one that is not for essentially the same price. A little more all said and done actually. I had no idea that the extra cost would be financed because I was shown one amount and then another actually ended up going to the bank. After complaining, this dealer's idea to ""make things right"" for me was to try to convince me to go upside down on my loan and buy a more expensive car from them. This was after they admitted to poor business practice and apologized profusely (I went through three reps, all of which claiming they would have never let what happened happen on their watch). When I wouldn't go along with their plan I was told how foolish I was for buying the car I bought in the first place, the one THEY sold to me a couple weeks earlier. This was after several people came out and made it sound like they would refund the money on my warranties but if I wanted they would swap the car out for the same bloated price of my current non-quality car + extended warranties. This was to keep me busy by showing me ""special"" cars so everyone else could quietly sneak out and go home. That way when I didn't bite they could say ""Well hey, were closed now so there's nothing else we can do"". The reason it took so long for me to realize the amount they financed for me was because I didn't get my paperwork for three weeks, then their bank(PNC) told me they didn't service the loan themselves and instead outsourced it. I was given a website that was invalid to get my info, then eventually found something by searching for individual parts of the bogus web address on Google. Imagine my surprise when I finally got to see the total amount financed. All I got prior to this was payment coupons in the mail with my monthly fee amount but no total cost. This dealer was dishonest, and then when I called them out on it they wasted my time and tried to double dip on the shady business practices. I will never do business with them again, and its a shame that this dealer has gone as far downhill as they have because I have bought cars from them in the past and had no issues. I would avoid, but if you must shop there be very careful and don't trust anyone no matter what they tell you.",1,0

Shalimar Hotel,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hostels, Hotels & Travel","Been a couple times in the past. I like Julio at the front desk. Mo is an idiot but the world needs ditch diggers. The young lady who works the days is cool. Grave yard guy, he's kewl too. His response when you ask for late check is hilarious because he says the time to go like that guy on Star Trek when he says She's giving it all she's got and you can't stays no more. The older lady and especially the old man are probably holding the place back from it's full potential. Common sitch where you got the money but not the people skills. The older lady slash owner is alright but make no mistake about it but you're in her house. The old man is cute in a look at that old man who is obviously a good hearted guy but his comments and actions come off a little crude maybe rude. I felt like I was visiting mom's house and should make my bed, change my sheets and maybe repair something before I leave. I disagree with the old man making the wife and I feel like pigs when I know my wife is OCD about cleaning the room because I make fun of her when she cleans the room before, during, and after our stay. We leave a tip anytime we feel like we've been a little laxed, it happens. Go enjoy your golden years with all that money you two old folks got and let Julio and the girl during the day run the place and trust someone.",2,0
Shalimar Hotel,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hostels, Hotels & Travel",Julio makes you feel like you're the man. You feel like you can do nothing but win until you begin to think to yourself how am I winning. I just paid full price and deposit and staying in the same old rooms from the previous visits before. I guess you can't be too picky here in Vegas cause you are gonna get what you get. They do strive to present themselves as a Hotel the Motel element isn't far behind. Different amenities available depending on the section of the hotel and room you stay. Fair price for the area and less rift raft around. I felt safe. Nice check out time at 12 and 1late check out upon request.,3,0
Shalimar Hotel,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hostels, Hotels & Travel","Budget-friendly hotel, located 4 min walk from the strip. The neighborhood is safe and there is no questionable characters walking around and asking for money, and offering some services. If on location, price, and safety I give to Shalimar 5 points. I was given the keys to a room that was clean, however the furnitures, the polliws - everything is old and shabby. As one can see from the picture I am attaching to my review, there is no flat tv but old fashioned ascilloscope tv that is barely working. The door is equped with a chain and kond of a ribbon is hanging from the door. The room is clean at all but impreganted with kind of a smell. Luckily found no cockroaches in the bathroom.",2,0
Shalimar Hotel,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hostels, Hotels & Travel","Why staying at the SHALIMAR Hotel can be good for you. by Suhein Beck When you don't have a choice and literally every respectable hotel in Vegas is fully booked because of the insanely busy Consumer Electronics Show, you find a way to be positive. Roughing it is good for you. Here are my reasons why Shalimar Motel in Vegas is actually a luxury health resort. When the shower head has virtually no water pressure, you are inclined to more vigorously massage your scalp to get rid of the shampoo and conditioner. This is awesome to stimulate blood flow and rejuvenate the problems of hair thinning and increase follicular growth! Great job Shalimar! Not to mention you are helping the environment and saving water. Bonus points for you! When the water temperature fluctuates between extreme hot and cold, you are actually experiencing ""HYDROTHERAPY."" This is a very advanced form of balneology water springs science technique of shocking your immune system to recalibrate and boost your metabolism instantly! This causes you to accelerate your breathing, thus pumping oxygenation of your blood! People pay thousands of dollars at European health resorts for this exact methodology for autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and rheumatoid ailments. You are freaking brilliant Shalimar Motel! The toilet requires you to hold down the flush handle for an extended 2 full minutes, sometimes 2-3 times per usage while the water circulates round and round in a relaxing, hypnotic way. This forces you to truly monitor your bowel movements in motion and be more conscious of your fiber intake each day. I found myself wondering, ""what did I eat yesterday...am I getting enough roughage...maybe tomorrow I'll just have fruits throughout the day instead..."" Thank you Shalimar for reminding me to make better dietary decisions while I'm in Vegas! The bathroom sink handles are reversed so that the hot water is controlled by the right handle and the left handle is for cold water. This challenges you to actually exercise the opposite muscles of brain/eye/hand coordination. No seriously, Leonardo da Vinci did this with his memoirs and notebooks as he used a mirror to write his discoveries so they would not be read and plagiarized so easily. This also exercised his brain to stay flexible and maximize both left and right spheres. Even brushing your teeth becomes a puzzle for the brain to keep adjusting the water temps constantly as it fluctuates. It's like a game...Shalimar Hotel - I wish everyone can discover how genius you are in your hospitality strategies for guests! The hair dryer that works in every other hotel that we take for granted is yet another reminder of how we are too dependent on devices that further damage our hair. Instead of using the heat to blow dry hair as usual, I was reminded to be creative to style my hair at night by twisting and tying my hair up in rubber bands to curl and add volume and let it dry naturally instead. By morning my hair was perfectly voluminous in a stylish way reminiscent of my hair glory days of the 80's. Shalimar Motel - your courage to stand alone in bringing guests to a new level of awareness is admirable! Most impressive was the mattress with springs that poke deeply into your knotted pressure points like the best of acupuncture/pressure massages. But instead of paying an average of $90 for a 1 hour session, I had a full 8 hours of body massage for 4 nights in a row! I don't know what to say to Shalimar Motel about this because surely I am not paying enough for their full health benefits package offered. Best ever science in sleep technology is to have the Heat/AC system located at pillow level just 4 inches from the bed. Each time the thermostat triggers it to loudly rumble on like an airplane at liftoff, I'd jump alarmed from my bed and wake up. What an adrenaline rush! I'm losing weight just by the amount of my reactionary Endocrine system resetting constantly! After the 4th cycle, my mind and body got into the groove of its rhythm and actually countered this by going into a much deeper sleep. This allows for Cortisol production to kick in around the 6th hour of sleep and that's when the weight loss hormones kick in! I didn't even hear it for the remainder of my quality time at Shalimar Motel! I wish all insomniacs to consider this strategy as an alternative to sleep disorder solutions. Now that I am fully aware of how a cheaply rated motel can offer much greater health benefits, I urge you to stop wasting your money on 4 & 5 star hotel/resorts and reconsider how your entire immune system can benefit with these brilliant survival techniques instead by roughing it like I did! You are welcome!",1,0

I am outraged by this place. it is privately owned by this family and the staff and the hotel doesn't give a crap about you or anyone they just want their money. they will lie and gas light you making it any mistake your fault. this place is connected to the white chapels in las vegas.

Shalimar Hotel,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hostels, Hotels & Travel",The room was decent for the price but there is no insulation so I could hear every door in the hallway (and loud Vegas people and children) all night long.

The wifi didn't work so I kept going down to say the password wasn't going through. The manager told me to go stand in the parking lot and see if it worked out there...? Later on we asked for a couple more towels and it was like a hostage trade. They would only give us new towels if we handed them the old used ones in return.

I've had to stay in 3 star hotels before (which this one is supposed to be) but I feel that giving this hotel 3 stars is over rating it. If I wasn't here for a family emergency I would have left.

Pretty sure a prostitute came in with a John to get a room while we were checking in. I was definitely skeeved out. That made me sleep on top of the sheets instead of in them. Also, When we got to the room and opened the door we immediately realized the room was actually a giant oven. The air had been off, just for the record it was over 100 degrees today. Took over two hours to get the room cool enough for comfort. It didn't really look super dirty. Its just a cheap run down place. No remote for the tv (probably got stolen) all the buttons were ripped off the phone. Ghetto AF but it worked for tonight. I won't be staying here again.",2,0

Shalimar Hotel,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hostels, Hotels & Travel","Wow. After reading some of the other reviews posted up, I must say I am surprised. We stayed there this past weekend 4/30/16-5/1/16 and had no issues whatsoever. What a lot of people tend to forget, is you get what you pay for. If you want to be cheap, you get a cheap room. Simple as that....We upgraded. First I want to give a HUGE shout out to Julio!! That guy is super nice. Took care of all of our concerns, upgraded us to a 3 bed for a REALLY decent price. The room was clean, the beds were nicely fixed up, and it was spacious. Beds were nice and soft, (we brought our own pillows). I especially loved the shower head...it was relaxing. No issues at all...I would definitely recommend this place to stay. As far as it being in a ""Bad Area"". Its a stones throw away from the Pawn Stars pawn shop...can't be that bad....",5,1
Shalimar Hotel,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hostels, Hotels & Travel","I just stayed here about two weeks ago. The pictures of the rooms on their website did NOT look like what I actually stayed in. The coffee maker was broken, they forgot to leave almost all the toiletries in the bathroom until the day we left, one towel was not fully bleached (gross), the halls smelled like stale cigarettes, the bed was hard as a rock, the pillows were paper thin and too hard, and to top it off the walls were also paper thin so you could hear everything around you. Unfortunately we stayed next to some terrible people who were partying until 3 in the morning. It took the front desk until 2 or 3 am to deal with all the complaints and get them to quiet down. I got no sleep that night. To their credit the pool area and lobby were very nice, and they have a restaurant and bar that were fairly nice as well. Over all though, I would not stay here again. I'd easily pay an extra 30 or 40 a night for a higher quality hotel. I should also note, this hotel is located in a very bad area of downtown Las Vegas.",1,0

Shalimar Hotel,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hostels, Hotels & Travel","I booked a 1king size non-smoking room via priceline. When i checked at about 10pm, i was given king bed/smoking room at first. Later on request I was shifted to another room which was Smoking room as well (forget about the bed size changing from king to queen in 2nd room) But as the hotel didnt had any other room, they insisted for me to believe that this was non-smoking room. The hotel manager further argued with me saying that they got booking confirmation from AGODA (Priceline partner) for Smoking room. I asked him to give me confirmation of my room from Agoda for smoking room which he didnt share with me. Inspite, it didnt seem like a big deal for him for providing non smokers family a room which stinks which smoke smell. He rather rudely replied to me to check out if I wasnt happy or to speak to AGODA. Its HOTEL business and the hotel staff is non courteous and non-responsible. I am writing this email on the same night of my stay with eyes swelled up and burning due to smoke effect and coughing non stop. The room lacked bathroom towels/iron board. The shampoos were even REFILLED (as the bottle seals were broke open already) and in bad old condition. I paid over $120 for the booking which is not worth it. Guys..STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE IF YOU WANT COMFORT AND ROOMS OF YOUR CHOICE. YOU GET HERE WHAT THEY ARE LEFT OUT WITH and bonus of ARROGANCE and RUDENESS. I called PRICELINE and they transferred to AGODA.

Shalimar Hotel,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hostels, Hotels & Travel","HORRIBLE AND DIRTY!!!!!! Save your money and don't stay here! This place is NOTHING like the pictures!!!! I read the reviews before booking there, but the pictures looks so nice that I decided to call the hotel and ask about the comments people were making on here. The owner said ""please don't listen to those. We have been in business for over 30 years and our rooms are very nice and clean"". So, I decided to give it a try. I booked two rooms last Saturday night. I booked directly through the owner (at least she said she was the owner). She quoted me a price and said she would email me the confirmation, but I never received it. I called the following day and asked them to send again, but still no email. Now I know why.....when I got there, they charged me $14 more for the room. I showed them my notes with the price and the name of the gal I made the reservation with. This time is was an older lady and she said she was the owner and that was her daughter-in-law and the price she quoted was wrong. At this time, without that email confirmation, I had no choice but to pay it. Once we got to the rooms, it was horrible!!!! The bathroom was so dirty with holes in the walls and floors. I can't believe they posted those pictures on the site...not even close! The blanket (the thin one) over the sheet was seriously dirty with stains, dirt, and hair. I called and asked for a clean blanket. The male owner came to my room and said ""what's your problem."" I showed him the dirty blanket and he said they did not have any more blankets but he would check housekeeping. I asked him how he can even use that dirty blanket. He said they do not clean the blankets after each guest visit. They clean them monthly but they do clean the sheets daily. What??!??!?!?!?!?! He appeared shocked that I wanted a clean blanket. He brought me a couple of sheets and said they did not have any more blankets in housekeeping. The ceiling had huge water stains on it, it was stinky, and the bathroom was disgusting! Finally, they say they would have a microwave in the room, they lied there too! I warn you, don't waste your money and sleep there!",1,0

Sheraton Desert Oasis Villas - Scottsdale,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Resorts, Hotels","My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights last week. We were joined by another couple (friends of ours) on the second and third nights. To start, it is very nice -- inside and out. They take great care of the rooms and the grounds. The overall vibe is low-key classy without being stuffy or pretentious. Staff and fellow vacationers were friendly, and we felt comfortable being ourselves. Complimentary coffee is available in the lobby in the early morning. Ice water is provided in both the lobby and by the pools throughout the day. There are two pools. One is a small ""Relaxation Pool,"" which is very quiet. The main pool is more what you'd expect at a resort. Open 8am-midnight, it's got music, activities, a waterfall, and hot tub. Towels and chairs provided; restrooms available; bar/grill located next to pool. Fitness center is also next to pool. There is a large collection of DVDs to borrow (free) or rent ($3/day) in the lobby just outside the little gift shop. Upon our arrival, Concierge called us persistently until we came down for our welcome packet, and then seemed a little annoyed at first when I finally did... That being said, they were helpful. They also offer daily activities at the resort. The location is OK. There's nothing around within walking distance (besides other neighboring resorts). The nearest grocery store, Starbucks, or restaurants are about a five-minute drive, and there aren't sidewalks along the busy main road, so you do need to arrange transportation. We never figured out the housekeeping situation, but I can say with certainty that they don't automatically come by to clean daily. My guess is it's upon request and at checkout. The room was close to spotless when we arrived, though. The bathtub is a whirlpool, which is pretty neat. Very weak fan/vent in the bathroom, but we survived. Comfy bed and couch, though the pillows are SUPER soft -- way too soft for me (I prefer very firm). Nice little kitchenette stocked with dishes, flatware, pans, cooking utensils, dish soap, and dishwashing pods. Washer and dryer in room with detergent for one load. Lovely balcony. We all enjoyed our stay at this beautiful resort.",4,1

Surprisingly quiet location on the north side of Scottsdale right off the 101 - close to tons of good restaurants, shopping, Taliesin West; everything we wanted to visit. The lobby shows an impressive Western style w a grand fireplace, rustic furniture & high wooden beam ceilings. If you get a chance to pop upstairs, you can see a beautiful aquarium as well. The verdant grounds are worth the stay - delightful garden settings w winding pathways, lush plantings, foot bridges & a fabulous Flintstones-style pool area, replete w waterfalls and big faux-boulders! Sounds corny, but it was actually cool. The rooms were reasonably priced, clean, well appointed & big enough for 2. Sliders onto the small balcony brought in nice breezes. The room layout seemed a bit chaotic, too many doors and angles per square foot. However, the small kitchen was well equipped, including a full size fridge and a 4-person dining table. A good place to stay for a week or so. The staff was outstanding - very helpful & friendly.

The deluxe one bedroom photos are actually a standard condo. On all other sites on the internet this condo is listed as a standard and the larger unit is the deluxe. Beware, there is no cook top or stove. Very disappointing. My reservation stated burners in lieu of stove. But oh no, not the case, only a microwave. Have you ever tried microwave boiled eggs? It's a disaster. So, on my fifth day, the resort calls me to offer a larger unit with a full kitchen. Too little, too late. Why did it take them this long to try to rectify all of this. Well, it must have been all of the bad reviews I have been writing about them. There is only a poolside restaurant available.

However this stay was totally different. I asked for a late check out and they said they are fully occupied and would not be able to accommodate me. Ok I understood so I went online to see if any other hotels had availability so I can book to stay for a few more hours and came across multiple sites that had rooms for this hotel so it was not fully booked. When I confronted the manager on duty (josh) he was shocked at my findings. Told him this would be my last stay here and then he said he would give me a room but I would have to switch rooms. Fine. So I told him I need a 9pm check out he said ok and gave me a bill. Next day at 7 pm my phone rang with the nastiest lady which was the manager (antonette or something like that) telling me I need to check out NOW or she would charge my credit card another night. I explained to her the manager (josh) gave me the room till 9 as she proceeded to call me a liar telling me she is with another employee that was there that day and that wasnt what was said! Told her I had an infant and I needed 30 minutes to get her ready so I can check out. We went to check out and her attitude was so far from how a manager running a hotel should speak to guests! After I explained a few things to her and asked for all 3 of there names her attitude fine tunes a little! I have never experienced such nasty attitude from any hotel before in my life!

We called the front desk right away and Ethan let us know that they were fully booked and the best that they could do was to put us in the model room for the night and then move us to an acceptable room the next day. We had no choice but to accept but because it was the model room, I was uneasy all night since I didn't know if linens are changed in model rooms or if they are, how often they're changed. The next morning we were moved to a different villa. This villa had no stovetop even though the first one we were in had one. I had to call for a electric burner. The towels were threadbare and a bit yellowed. The corners of the room needed vacuuming and the dishes in the cupboard weren't completely clean. I spent a good hour of our first day handwashing every dish, utensil, pot, and pan in the kitchen. Fast forward to our midweek ""cleaning"". They replaced towels and made the bed but that's about it. They also replaced toiletries. As far as I could see, no vacuuming had been done and definitely no dusting. There were quite a bit of activities on the resort but this resort charged for activities that other resorts usually offer for free. The pool was nice and probably the thing we took advantage of the most. They also had a quaint little gift shop that had some nice souvenirs and snacks.

First, I was able to check in very early and check out late. The villa was nicer than I expected. The bathroom needs painting but everything else was great. The pools were clean. The staff was fabulous from the front desk to the activity team to the servers. I would have preferred a real restaurant and bar. Splash was not good. Also, while the grounds are beautiful, the location is not ideal for me. Overall the value was very good and I would stay there again.",4,1

The on-site grills were all spotless and had people grilling the most fabulous smelling foods. We wanted to invite ourselves to their meal and did with a gentleman grilling steaks! Very friendly guests. I absolutely would return! My only wish is they had an on-site restaurant besides the poolside cafe, but the cafe's food was reasonably priced and quite good!

This Sheraton got high reviews and offered an excellent military rate of $159/night for a deluxe suite. Or, is that sweet? What a deal! The ""villa"" was a spacious 1-bedroom unit with a full kitchen, dining area, and living room. A fireplace in the living room and another in the bedroom. Wow! Jetted bathtub in the bedroom plus a super sleek shower in the bathroom. The facility is large, spacious, and super clean with plenty of privacy. Free parking. Free wi-fi. Pool area is super clean. Clientele is primarily 60s and older, but there was a fair share of families as well. Located near a large park, which makes for a great morning run. Unfortunately, I had only one night here.

Sheraton Desert Oasis Villas - Scottsdale,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Resorts, Hotels","This was my first time staying there. One of our friends got us a good deal and 7 of us decided to spend the night there last weekend. It's a nice resort. The suites have everything you need for a comfortable stay. The kitchen's small but this is a timeshare kinda of resort and so it doesn't matter, really. I imagine there's not a lot of cooking when you're on vacation but still the kitchen was fully equipped. The bathroom was a good size and so was the bedroom. The sofa's a pull out sofa and it's queen size so 4 people can stay there without feeling too cramped. The pools are nice. There's a smaller pool where kids aren't allowed so it's quiet and relaxing. Then there's the big pool with the hot tub (big hot tub) and a splash pad area too. They also have a bar by the pool. Some of my friends ordered drinks and they say they were delicious! The resort's clean and the customer service's good. I'll definitely go back soon if I'm capable of doing it.",4,1

The living room, with the fireplace controlled by a switch is great, and the TV is very large and great quality. We found an extra cuddly blanket and have enjoyed curling up on the comfy couch. The bed...oh my gosh. Haven't been that cozy in a long time. Feels like we are sleeping on clouds. Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this location and will be back whenever we can get away for a weekend.

Sheraton Desert Oasis Villas - Scottsdale,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Resorts, Hotels","The in-laws used some timeshare points for a week stay here. We got two sides, a larger and smaller side. While I'm used to having more things to do in a resort setting, the jacuzzi was nice sized, as was the pool. But a basketball hoop in the pool wouldn't be a bad addition. Heck there's enough room for it. Room cleanliness was not an issue and the kitchen had a enough to get by for a while. However, they supplied metal kitchen utensils for cooking (i.e. Spatulas, etc.) which detrimentally affects pots and pans. I think the non-stick on our pan was shoddy because of this. My wife had one consistent complaint: the pillows were iffy. Your head sinks straight away and offers little support. If I had a chance to do this again, I'd probably rather stay at the Kierland resort instead.",4,1
Sheraton Desert Oasis Villas - Scottsdale,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Resorts, Hotels","First time at this resort. Exchanged our Wyndham vacation points for a unit here. Be sure to get a 1 BR with full kitchen. You can same some $$$ buy cooking your own food. Sam's Club and Costco are nearby and there's a Fry's closeby and the property offers shuttle service there. Bedroom and living room each have fireplaces in them; and the BR has a large jacuzzi. Furnishings are nice and there are 2 large LCD TVs (one in BR and 1 in LR) Staff are very friendly and helpful. Injured my foot on this trip and the front desk person made sure that we got a bottom floor unit. Pool was a little far, but the front desk gave me a choice of either a peaceful/serene view or closer quarters to the pool. I opted for the view and didn't regret it. They do try to get you to attend one of their property presentations, but you get a $100 Amex gift card for your time along with discounts at a bunch of establishments.",5,1

I have not had a vacation in over 2 years and was due. I loved the room, hospitality and location. There was only one minor issue and the front desk stated that they would look into horseback riding and if a company would accompany a 5 year old and they never got back to me. But, we had a fantasic time swimming at the pool instead. I would go back there in a heart beat.",5,1
Sheraton Desert Oasis Villas - Scottsdale,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Resorts, Hotels","Yes. It's a desert oasis. Go figure. Updated villa rooms include kitchen with all of the amenities, comfortable bed and furnishings. Close to everything including the 101 freeway. As part of the Starwood network, this is a dedicated time-share property which also offers regular revenue rates to non-owners or those who traded properties. IF you are an owner, I would forgo the higher-StarPoint required Kierland Villas. This is about 1 mile away and still close to all of the shops, restaurants and entertainment of Arizona. You're never in the room anyway. YOU are on the lounge chair sipping frosty cocktails at the pool. What they should do is charge for the lounge chair and throw in the actual room for free! Just sayin'. Family friendly but also good for singles and couples no matter your age. People are relatively friendly on property or pool and ask where you are from. Visit the grocery stores nearby including Basha's up on Bell Road, about 2 miles from resort or Frys north on Hayden Road. Get yourself some bottled water, snacks, lunchy food,etc, to take to the pool and avoid the averaged priced items.",4,1
Sheraton Desert Oasis Villas - Scottsdale,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Resorts, Hotels","As far as the property is concerned - It is a wonderful place to stay at if you are looking for A+ accommodations in a perfect area of Phoenix. many of the reviews you can read here do a VERY GOOD job of describing the rooms and the photos are accurate. The front desk and staff are all very pleasant and customer service oriented too. Now I'll tell you about the bad experience. As a current timeshare owner here since its original build around 1998 (under Embassy Suites at the time), we want to make other current owners aware of the dishonest sales practices and misinformation the Starwood sales representatives at the Sheraton Desert Oasis are doing. We have thoroughly enjoyed being timeshare owners since this time until now. Our visit in February 2011 changed our perspective on the professionalism, integrity, and honesty of the ""Ownership Update"". It had been years since we have had the chance to visit our home resort and looked forward to an Owner Update. Yes, we did understand that sales comes into play sometimes during these meetings for updates of new features and changes of the timeshare program. The sales representatives introduced us to the new Starwood Vacation Network (SVN), use of points, options, and other choices with the newer system of which we were not a part of. We were quite excited and interested in the new flexibility and wanted to make the change from the traditional ownership we had. During this time we were told that original members we had missed the opportunity to change over to SVN. We were told that in order to move our current unit owned at Sheraton Desert Oasis, we HAD to buy another timeshare. Doing this was the only way to bring our membership over to the Starwood Network. We were kind of troubled about having to buy another just to get moved to points since we already had the biggest unit at this property. It really didn't make any sense. Of course they came back with what was seemingly more affordable - a small 1 bedroom biannual timeshare that would get us in and move our current ownership. We asked for them to list all the fees we would need to expect and was told outside of the biannual maintenance fees, we would only have to pay a fee if we had to use Interval International to make an exchange. At that point they left us in order for us to review and discuss our finances and decide on what to do. We both thought hard about this and decided we could manage the amount looking at the numbers we were presented and maintenance fee that we should expect. On March 14th, we received a bill regarding the maintenance fee for the new ownership purchase (which was expected). On the bill was also an SVN membership fee that was assessed for the amount of $119.00. When I contacted Association Management, I was informed that this fee is a yearly fee to be part of the network (Not mentioned). Furthermore, when I contacted Owner Services to find out how long it would take to get our existing original ownership transitioned to the point system, I was told that it would cost $599.00 to do this AND WE DID NOT NEED TO PURCHASE another unit to get into the point system program. At no point in time, did they make an effort to give us honest information regarding how we could move to the Starwood Vacation Network point system, they did not tell us all the various membership fees for each unit, and possibly other charges that we haven't seen yet. We are really disappointed and feel very deceived with the sales practice we experienced. Not only has our trust in timeshare sales been broken, but I feel a consumer protection against this type of failure needs to get placed into law (if it is not already). Equally important, we want to be certain that other current owners do not experience this deceitful practice. No telling how many other owners have been tricked to buy another unit when they could have simply made the change by calling Owner Services. Unfortunately, the sales team there could not resolve our matter and claimed they knew nothing about the $599 option for current owners. Yet after sending several complaint letters/emails/etc in early April, we were contacted by the sales representative at Sheraton Desert Oasis to be told that he received an email that the promotion was ending soon (raises a question to integrity doesn't it?). Of course they could not forward that announcement, but we did receive an official email on April 28, 2011 stating that the option to change over would end on May 31, 2011.",2,0

Sheraton Desert Oasis Villas - Scottsdale,"Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Resorts, Hotels","Sheraton Desert Oasis is a great value in the late spring/early summer to get away for a few days and relax. It is part of the Starwood Hotel Chain, but this is one of their first forays in to the recent boom in Hotel chains opening time share residences for sale under their brands. So this was meant to be property that was sold in timeshares, which some have. mostly for winter weeks for cold snow birds. But in the low season, which is summer, you can get a room for around $100. And what do you get? You get a nicely appointed, decorated model home, about a 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. It is repleat with 2 gas fireplaces, full kitchen with all wares and utensils, living room, patio with table and chairs, his/her bathroom sinks, a marbled tiled shower, a king size bed and a heart shaped large jacuzzi bathtub in the bedroom. It has a full social and activities calender, so it is a good place to take the kids. There is a large clover shaped pool, with multiple water fountains, and a large rocklike island structure with caves where the jacuzzi is located. There are about 75 chaise lounges and several tables, so there is usually one available for you. There is also a poolside grill for food and beverages. You are not far from the restaurants and nightlife of North Scottsdale, near Kierland Commons Mall, Desert Ridge Mall, 101 Mall, and about 6 other strip and big box shopping centers. You can buy food and easily eat in to save some money. The famed Tournament Players Club (TPC) gold course is close by, as well as the more exclusive and expensive Fairmont Princess hotel. This is more of a vacation home than an exclusive resort with people waiting on you hand and foot. But it is well maintained, nicely appointed, and a relaxing getaway. Peak season (winter) rates are $325 and up, so if you come in early summer, you get a bargain and a tan by the pool.",4,1

The bed linen was clean even with the comforters on top being white. The bathroom was clean and well stocked with the usual toiletries and the rest of the room was clean including the carpet. We surely got our money's worth staying outside of Pittsburgh instead of a much more expensive downtown hotel and this was with four of us (a double and a pull out sofa bed). Breakfast was outstanding though on the first morning of our visit I did not make it down and preferred to sleep in. Corey puts out the complimentary breakfast every morning and she was very efficient with replenishing the eggs, muffins, sausage, etc and everything was very tasty, delicious, and fresh. Even the coffee was superb and always present in the lobby. Corey is also very friendly and a great conversationalist. She is truly an asset to the hotel experience. I could not believe how delicious the coffee was in those silver dispensers and everyday and all day there is lemon infused water in the lobby. Daugherty Street on the first day, was full of ice and it was difficult getting up the hill to the hotel but the parking lot was cleared and the traffic from Monroeville through the tunnel on 376 during rush hour were the only negative findings and they have nothing to do with our otherwise pleasant stay.

For me, I LOVE this sort of stuff! And also my family paid for my admission. I am originally from Wisconsin so I grew up knowing about Frank Lloyd Wright. I was really looking forward to my visit to Taliesin West, and I was not disappointed. The house is bigger than I expected, but as it functions also as an operating school of architecture where students live and work, it makes sense that it is larger than a single home. Dummy that I am, I just didn't know about the school part of it all! FLW was an awesome designer and an interesting person and you get to learn about both on the tour. Details are all around and everything is like a work of art. Even the unique, plywood furniture in the massive living room! The totally stainless steel minuscule bathroom! Not to mention the literal art that fills the home and gardens! The tour was great and the guide was friendly and informative and willing to answer all questions. I was just overwhelmed with all of the details to look at! I loved every single second and took more pictures than I would care to admit. If you are interested and can swing the admission price, this is a worthy place to spend a few hours.

Taliesin West,"Event Planning & Services, Local Flavor, Hotels & Travel, Architectural Tours, Professional Services, Arts & Entertainment, Architects, Tours, Travel Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Museums","Taliesin West emerges naturally from the desert floor -you can't see it on approach because it's built with a low profile and designed to blend in with its desert surroundings. The complex just outside Scottsdale, AZ., was architect Frank Lloyd Wright's winter home, workplace, and school in the desert from 1937 until his death in 1959 at the age of 91. Drawing its name from Frank Lloyd Wright's summer home (Taliesin, in Spring Green, WI), it's the main campus of the School of Architecture and houses the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. Many of Wright's most famous buildings were designed in the drafting room here (including the Guggenheim Museum in NYC). Open to the public for tours, Taliesin West is located on Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard in Scottsdale, Arizona (a suburb of Metropolitan Phoenix). The place is amazing, with stunning desert views of Scottsdale and Phoenix beyond (though marred by the power lines FLW wrote President Truman about, demanding they be removed and rerouted because they detracted from his view of the desert) and amazing configurations --a must see for any FLW fan! The tour would be interesting for anyone who appreciates home design --Wright used sweeping horizontal lines in residential structures while other architects were still creating tall houses with lots of ""gingerbread"" as decoration. There is a very nice gift shop on the site near the entrance with an abundance of books, ties, mugs, T-shirts --and all things FLW. We came out for the signature ""Behind the Scenes"" (3 hour) Tour and were not disappointed -it was amazing! We had the chance to tour Wright's office, his living room and spaces, the design studio, movie theater, and even the cabaret. It is fascinating to see how Wright designed every aspect of the complex, down to the furniture, windows (or not as he opposed using glass and preferred open space leading to the outdoors), artwork and floor coverings. Every part of Taliesin West bears Frank Lloyd Wright's personal touch -the grounds are serene and supremely modern. Upon every return after a summer in Wisconsin, Wright would grab a hammer and immediately make his way through the complex, walking through each room making changes or shouting orders to apprentices closely following with wheelbarrows and tools -constantly changing and improving upon his design. Throughout the years he added an additions to the dining room, music pavilion and on numerous other rooms throughout the compound. All of the furniture and decorations (now reproductions) were designed by Wright and the majority were built by his apprentices. A brilliant aspect of Wright's design is the cabaret theatre. Built with six sides, out of the standard rock-concrete mixture, in an irregularly hexagonal shape (out of the standard rock-concrete mixture) the theatre provides its occupants with what has been called ""95% acoustic perfection"". Someone sitting in the back row can hear the lightest whisper from a speaker on stage. A fascinating insight --FLW's investment of over $10,000 was needed, to dig a well deep enough (500 ft.) to provide sufficient water for the campus -in fact, it's an underground river running from the White Mountains near the eastern Arizona border with New Mexico. When Wright and his family arrived in 1937 they found Native American petroglyphs among the rocks. One, the Whirling Arrow (seen today at the beginning of the guided tour), shows what Wright interpreted as two hands clasped in a gesture of friendship. a reflection of his creative vision and philosophical belief of ""stay(ing) close to nature, it will never fail you."" Wright stylized the figures into interconnected lines, which became the symbol of Taliesin West. During his lifetime, Wright continually altered and added to the complex of buildings, all of which were constructed by students. Many of Wright's most famous buildings were designed in the drafting room at Taliesin West (including the Guggenheim Museum in NYC). The School of Architecture at Taliesin West offers an accredited Master of Architecture (M.Arch) degree focused on Wright's principals. Taliesin West continues as the headquarters of The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and as the winter home for the School of Architecture offering an accredited Master of Architecture (M.Arch) degree focused on Wright's principles (as in Wright's day, students and faculty spend the summers in Spring Green, Wisconsin). You can sense the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Wright (as the apprentices called them) as you take the tour. of the property. It's amazing! You're allowed to take pictures everywhere (except the drafting studio --due to the possibility of intellectual property being exposure). We actually ran into a couple of students who offered their greetings and quick asides about their experiences of living there. The three-hour Behind the Scenes Tour was well worth the extra time and money ($75). Tours sell out fast so pre-purchasing tickets is strongly advised.",5,1

If you are interested in architecture and the thought processes of a great innovator, the tour spotlights Mr. Wright's genius while it at the same time explains the lives of the people who lived there and how the property went from a winter home to a permanent school of architecture.

My husband and I went to this place on our anniversary with a few architects friends thinking that we would see a building of where Frank Lloyd Wright lived and worked and that was it. I thought it would be this boring tour that our friends were pumped about but honestly...it was amazing! The tour guides were so knowledgeable and even my friends who were in the ""business of making buildings"" were just completely in awe of their knowledge. The buildings all had beautiful interesting stories especially his living room with the hole in the wall for the vase he wanted...weird but SOOOO cool! The living quarters were just the highlight I would say along with the dragon. :) We didn't get to see it lit up but you can see pictures and the burnt bushes around it and imagine its beauty. I would say my FAVORITE place was the amphitheater. The way the piano placement the acoustic were literally GENIUS! We also met one of FLW's original students while we were visiting the amphitheater and he told us his stories of his major fails and how the campus looked back in the day and all in all it was a great day. One draw back was parking SUCKED and the drive up and down the mountain was a little...um...scary because the road is narrow. Just a couple tips. 1. Buy early online. These tours sell out even on random days. (It happened to us.) 2. If a tour is sold out for the time, as long you don't have A TON of people with you, they general will let you add in during that time slot. Go to the gift shop very quietly and ask if you can join the group you wish and pay. They will only tell you no if they don't have space.",4,1

Taliesin West,"Event Planning & Services, Local Flavor, Hotels & Travel, Architectural Tours, Professional Services, Arts & Entertainment, Architects, Tours, Travel Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Museums","We had reservations for the night tour. It is a 2 hour tour that takes you through many of the buildings and Frank Lloyd Wrights own rooms. You even can sit on Frank Lloyd Wright's furniture! The view of Camelback Mountain and the Praying Monk is great. Plus if you do the night tour in the summer, you will probably get to watch the sunset and cooler temperatures. The night tour also features a small statue of a dragon that breathes real fire. Be aware if you opt to do the night tour, the book store closes after the night tour starts so come early if you want to buy something. We learned lots of neat things about Frank Lloyd Wright like how he designed not only the homes, but he designed the furniture for the homes he built and arranged the furniture in the homes for his clients. Taliesin West is unique as it was his own home, so he had no client to please and built it as he wished. Our tour guide was great. Our tour had about 30 people in it. It wasn't too many people we felt, and we heard the tour guide just fine. Some doors in the buildings are a little narrow, just be aware. For AZ residents, Taliesin West was offering a 50% off discount for tours through 08/31 when we visited last week. The discount code we used was AZResident. Definitely worth seeing though if you are a local or have out of state guests visiting! Enjoy some AZ history!",5,1
Taliesin West,"Event Planning & Services, Local Flavor, Hotels & Travel, Architectural Tours, Professional Services, Arts & Entertainment, Architects, Tours, Travel Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Museums","During my first (and perhaps only) visit to Scottsdale, I wasn't going to mess around with a simple tour only to leave wanting more. I jumped straight to the biggest 3-hour behind-the-scenes tour. Considering how many times we ran into other tour groups, it didn't seem like we were seeing much more than the other tours. At least the longer tour took us to the best location - the archivist's (Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer) house. Done in a completely different style from the angular rock and concrete bases of Taliesin, the house was based on circles. A modest-sized creation, the residence had elegant form and simplistic creativity - just what I want to see. This was unlike the rest of Taliesin. The first role of a building is shelter from the surrounding environment. When a shelter doesn't protect its contents, it is a failure. I don't care if the shelter is pretty or adheres to a concept when it doesn't fulfill its immediate function. After being rebuilt multiple times, Taliesin still has trouble reaching this objective. Thankfully, Frank Lloyd Wright didn't design airplanes, boats, or bridges because the planes wouldn't fly, the boats would be prone to sinking, and the bridges would likely collapse. Along with failing to serve its primary purpose, the buildings had terrible blue triangles, head-bumping low ceilings (and not just at the entrances), uncomfortable chairs, and tables with little room for legs. I can see why FLW didn't stay here year around. I had trouble staying in any room longer than 10 minutes. I'm not the only person with issues as FLW's wife was critical of his design. It's better to see the building from outside anyhow to enjoy the long and lean roof lines that are smoothly integrated with the gardens and fountains. Because FLW spent significant time here, our tour guide had stories which gave insight into his stubborn behavior which fits with his Spartan living, sleeping, and working areas. A visit to Taliesin isn't as much about seeing great architecture, but investigating the mind set of a great architect. I can't deny that Taliesin is a nurturing training ground for architects to help expand their passion for lifelong creativity, but this is NOT one of FLW's better works.",4,1

That's the word that completely describes Frank Lloyd Wright. Everything about this place is genius. Even the location is genius. There's something here for everyone. A bit nerdy? No problem, you'll be fascinated by how FLW designed things. What looks simple is actually quite complex when you examine it closely. Into the beauty? Also no problem; he has no problem using bright colors to please the senses.. Into landscaping and the desert? Got it covered. I recommend the 90 minute guided tour for full impact. It'll be the most peaceful and educational 1 1/2 hours you've spent in a long time. Tip: If you buy tickets online (go to their site) you can save a few dollars.",5,1

The tour gives you an idea of the life of Frank Lloyd Wright and the building of the home and school. The tour is pretty robust too. One tour provided a few more rooms than the other but all were a great glimpse at the property and explanation of the school. The focus is definitely on Mr. Wright's time there. The school is interesting and unique and you can get an idea of how it's run. On neither tour did we see students, however. The tour reminds me a bit of Hearst Castle ... but not as good. I usually dislike museum gift shops because they just look like a revenue opportunity but the gift shop here is really good -- has tons of interesting books, art and other items. What's interesting is there is a architectural diagram of the state capital building done by Mr. Wright that has a tall purple tower, which has been built recently along Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. If you're fascinated by Mr. Wright, his life, the school and architecture, you should definitely make this a visit.",4,1

This was probably my favorite thing we did on our short trip to Phoenix in April. I've read about FLW- both non-fiction and historical fiction - and this was the first of his houses I've been able to see. It was so cool to be able to sit in the room where he held ""Taliesin Nights"" and sit at the table where he would meet with clients. I love that it's a working architecture school. Having students live and work at Taliesin keeps it a living, breathing work of art. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and I enjoyed learning more about FLW. It inspired me to want to tour the country visiting all his houses!! After reading about Taliesin, I still had no idea how to pronounce it until I got there. FYI, it's ta-lee-EH-sin.",5,1

Dwayne, the guide, was animated, passionate, informative, and gave us more than 90 minutes of facts, stories, and intrigue about FLW and the amazing space the Taliesin West represents. Based on my experience, I could not recommend anything but the 90 minute tour. If you've driven our there, pay the extra few dollars (which supports good work, philosophy, and learning) and indulge your mind. They feature several discounts for the 60 and 90 minutes tours, including those for seniors and active military. Be forewarned; a large portion of the tour features the outside elements and on a cold and rainy day it can be a bit of a burden without proper clothes and an umbrella. Even moving inside can be a challenge due to FLW's insistence on using canvas sheets for the roof. Kick ass stuff!",5,1

All I can say is drop what you are doing now and go. This place is amazing! You do not have to be a big archi lover to enjoy the wonders of this place. (And the view aint half bad either) If you get the Culture Pass that the Phx Libraries offer you can get the basic tour for free. 4 passes at 26 dollars a pop for free can you believe it? It only costs a few more dollars to upgrade to the next tour. BARGAIN!!!!!!! You have to go on a tour you just can't go and wander around there since people live here and it is a private school. ( BTW that Culture Pass thing is a gem! I might have to write a separate review for it!) bring tons of water, walking shoes,hats, your camera, and be forewarned it is hot. A lot of the tour is outside or in hotter buildings with little air venting but hey a small price to pay to see this place of a great minded man! PS- we did bring a small child. Although most people on here say it is not child friendly children may enjoy it if they are interested in art or old buildings. I must say they would have to be children who have been exposed to longer tours at musuems before so use caution. The tour guides love kids though so if you have an inquisitive little one bring them along. .",5,1

Taliesin West,"Event Planning & Services, Local Flavor, Hotels & Travel, Architectural Tours, Professional Services, Arts & Entertainment, Architects, Tours, Travel Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Museums","We just returned from the 4th of July Red, Wright, and Blue event. Not sure if publicly advertised as we received a card in the mail since we have a membership. This particular event was $60 a ticket. That bought a tour, food, 2 drinks, music, and seating for the fireworks. I'm not quite sure what the tour was supposed to entail as we got quite the thunderstorm, and all the guides were improvising to keep people indoors as much as possible. I believe it was a modified Insights tour. Our tour guide actually looked nervous, as if she wasn't sure the roof would not cave in! The rain offered a very different perspective. We know the living room leaks:) It was quite spectacular actually. Food and entertainment was indoors. As we understand, this was not the case last year, and it was supposedly pretty dang hot. The food was a light meal (appetizer, barbecue sliders, and dessert). The rain cleared in time for the fireworks around the Valley and dropped the temperature considerably making for a beautiful evening. You can actually watch several shows at once. Although the fireworks are all at a distance, it is quite amazing to see several shows simultaneously against the city lights, and in our case, intermingled with lightning. Awesome. I wish the entertainment had moved outdoors, however, to drown out the loud-mouthed, know-it-all next to us. Can't have everything I guess. Every tour we have taken has been informative. We have enjoyed all of the guides, and each offers little tidbits of info on Wright's work, his life, and his personality that you won't have heard before. When we purchased a membership, tours were only available May through September, I believe. Now, they have a wider variety of tours available year-round. I would HIGHLY recommend tours in the cooler weather as some of the living areas are not cooled, and even the ones that are cooled are still quite warm. Check out their website www.franklloydwright.org for details, prices, etc. Great place to take architectural buffs or HGTV fans.",4,1

Thanks to my friend Brian coming into town, I finally decided it was time. We did the Insight tour which took us into Frank Lloyd Wright's office, living room, bedroom and various theaters. It was a great tour and our guide, Betty was very knowledgeable on all things Wright. She invited questions and never hesitated with the answers. On the tour we even had the opportunity to sit in the furniture that FLW designed and made. It's awesome because the site is not considered a museum, so we were able to take pictures and touch everything. The foundation offers a variety of tours, so I will definitely be back to check out some of the other ones. The only downside is that the tours are a little pricey, but not outlandish considering the amount of information and access you get. Our tour was about $30 and took 90 minutes. The longer tours cost more, but based on this one, I think it was well worth it.",5,1
Taliesin West,"Event Planning & Services, Local Flavor, Hotels & Travel, Architectural Tours, Professional Services, Arts & Entertainment, Architects, Tours, Travel Services, Venues & Event Spaces, Museums","I was visiting Scottsdale for a long weekend and decided to take in Taliesin West. I am not a Frank Lloyd Wright fan, but I did enjoy a past visit to Fallingwater, so I decided to check this place out. A lot of people feel that Mr. Wright was a genius, I just think he had a strong and different point of view. And liked to go a little crazy with it. I'm not overly impressed with his style, but I do enjoy a chance for a little voyeurism, and to me, that's what this is. And while I did enjoy my visit, this property is not as beautiful or impressive as Fallingwater, which is spectacular. I did take the 90 minute insights tour which the web sites proclaims to be ""our most popular tour"". It's just more popular because it's offered every 30 minutes. The new price for 2008 is $32, which I think is over inflated. Our tour guide was a nice enough guy, but I didn't really appreciate his little side stories in which he liked to tell tales about the man's integrity or hinted (not so subtly) about the lack of it. If we want to know more about Mr. Wright personally, let us all read fact filled books, not hear myths from the Valley. I was here to see his impressive work not to hear him insulted. There was so much more to this man than these little tales could tell. I urge everyone to read about the man's life and career. You will be fascinated. The bookstore/foundation store is full of books about the architect and his works. I found it to be very interesting and wished I would have had more time to spend there. Taliesin West was a crude escape from the harsh Midwest winters. That's what it is and that's what it looks like. I did find it to be a fascinating step back in time.",4,1

Not updated...yet. No handy outlets in bedside light or on the desk. Hallways have failing wallpaper border I noticed on the 6th floor as well. Upside for me, I got the latest checkout time ever... and I don't need it this time!! Oh the irony. Still no microwave in room. :( But, fridge, and little coffee maker, iron & board, luggage rack. Black light sweep was average. Black light shows drapes need laundering - that's not something I thought I'd see. Black light also revealed that the carpet had some areas needing cleaning. But! Bed was clean. Quiet enough, although the #01 rooms are right beside the elevator lobby and some yahoos don't get that. Another toilet leaking - I think it's likely that they have all aged and many it's just time to have the guts replaced. This time I was smart enough to shut off the water to the toilet *before* going to bed! Yes! Rods to close drapes missing or broken. Still flimsy and too short for a 5'0 tall human to use when reaching over furniture. Forces a person to grab the drape, which causes premature wear. TV remote doesn't have a sleep feature I could find, seems typical of most of the rooms I've had lately. Towels were great. Shower water pressure at 8am fluctuated a bit. Koehler shower head nice but spray a little light to get shampoo out of thick hair. Kudos for the hair dryer! It was a rocket! Great new little Andis unit. Luggage carts have solid wheels.

The area it is located in looks sketchy - I don't know Calgary very well, but there seems to be an absence of people in this area at night. When we came to check in, the front desk person looked at my reservation as if I had just plunked down the two tablets of the 10 commandments. After staring with awe, making photocopies, and conferring with his superior, he admitted they did not have my reservation on their system. He seemed to be doing quadratic equations in his head for about 20 minutes when he decided to test the revolutionary idea of looking at the 2nd name on the reservation - this name WAS on their system, so he was able to get each of us a room. Room was comfortable, flat screen TV and free WIFI made up for the fumble at the front desk, and the Globe & Mail in the morning was a nice surprise. Restaurant wad short-staffed. Noted on the menu ""no substitutions"", which I translate to ""we don't aim to please"". Luckily, I'll eat anything and my skillet was quite good. Overall, the place is quite dated, staff was mediocre, but it didn't seem like there was another hotel in the immediate area and it had the flat screen TV and free WIFI, so for the price paid, I'd say it was good value and I'd probably stay there again when I'm back in Calgary for another course.",2,0

They are known in Calgary for being one of the most convenient hotels in Calgary for weddings. It is a big part of the event business for them. Glenmore Inn is an all-inclusive wedding venue. For a single fee, you are covered for the location, food, alcohol, and pretty much anything else you can think of. It's very convenient, as you are not running around paying a bunch of different people. But it's also not cheap. Our estimate worked out to around $80/person. Not exorbitant, but not inexpensive either. When we went to sit down with their wedding coordinator, it was a really great experience. She was very thorough and asked all the right questions. They are able to accommodate the ceremony, which you will quickly discover is not the same for all hotels. They usually have their ceremonies in their restaurant, which is open and nice enough that it would actually look really nice. In the end, we decided that the price, location (we were looking for somewhere downtown or further north), and room didn't fit what we were looking for. But as I've mentioned before, the people you deal with should define your choice. And the event coordinator we dealt with was fantastic.

In our recent move from Chicago to Phoenix we decided to rent for 6 months to figure out where we wanted to buy a home. We only had 45 days after our home in Chicago went under contract and we knew finding a place would be a challenge, especially in the Arizona ""high season"". Marisol Ryner came to our rescue and found us a unit in the amazing community of Toscana! She managed to snag us a beautifully furnished unit for 6 months at a price that was budget friendly for us. We love it here! We can walk to the mall, movies, restaurants, and entertainment venues. The community has a wonderful pool and health club facility too! Marisol was extremely professional, upbeat, and informative. She has such a ""can do!"" philosophy and was quick to respond to our many questions. If you need a place to stay for a few days or for half a year...this is a great place to check out!",5,1
Toscana Condo Rentals,"Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Casinos, Event Planning & Services, Vacation Rentals, Arts & Entertainment","Such an excellent place to stay. The price was unbelievable. There were 5 of us in the 2 bedroom condo which was just perfect. We used the kitchen which was fully stocked with everything we needed. The pool and spa were clean and great to lay out by. The staff was friendly and went out of there way to accommodate us. It is definately a ""family"" feel resort. Not many young people, great for long term renting. Everything you need is right there, along with a string of shops walking distance from Toscana. It looks like they are still renovating some sections but we did not experience any construction while we were there for the 2 days. I would recommend for sure unless you want a hotel vibe. This is more of a vacation rental spot, no 24 hour front desk, room service etc.",5,1
Toscana Condo Rentals,"Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Casinos, Event Planning & Services, Vacation Rentals, Arts & Entertainment","This place is amazing! I booked three nights with their summer deal - about $80 per night plus $15 resort fees. Everything in the condo is furnished with modern and new furniture. It was like living in an ikea model home. Everything was really clean. It felt like luxury! The swimming pool, jacuzzi, game room, and gym room are great. The only thing that I don't like about this place is that they only allow one car per condo.",5,1
TownePlace Suites Cleveland Airport,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Overall a nice location. The building isn't the most up to date and the lobby is super small.

Breakfast was free and adequately stocked with items, nothing special though.",4,1
TownePlace Suites Cleveland Airport,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I came to this hotel primarily because of the complimentary hotel shuttle and I had an early flight out. The front desk and my suite were both very clean. The night staff at the front desk was pretty helpful. I called with a question while enroute from Michigan and he took the initiative to get my name and uodated arrival time. This sped up my check in process. The breakfast area was very small and from what I could tell there was not that much of a variety of items, basically continental breakfast with a few perks. The only con of my stay was that there was a group of 15 in one room making a lot of noise late into the night. When we walked to our room, down the hall from the front desk, the smell of marijuana was very strong. Upon check out We learned that this was the group if 15 in one room.",4,1
TownePlace Suites Cleveland Airport,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","The hotel is nice and rates are reasonable. Pros: the staff is friendly and accommodating be it the front desk, housekeeping, the breakfast room... they are all very good. Rooms are basic but nice. Couple odd things - no exhaust fans in the bathrooms? What's with that? The breakfast room is the smallest I have ever seen. It's just a couple tables. If everyone tried to get breakfast around the same time it would be comical. Also as a heads up the hotel is two separate buildings so half the rooms are across the parking lot from the front desk, breakfast,the room with the treadmill etc. so you won't be running down to grab a snack at midnight in your socks if you're across the lot.",4,1

TownePlace Suites Cleveland Airport,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","Great Place to stay in Cleveland!!!! Clean, helpful and nice staff!!! My family had to be in the Cleveland area for over 10 days and I found this hotel to be wonderful. The facility is clean and staff is wonderful. I had to bring my two dogs and most all the time they come with me but one day they had to stay in the room. They were not good, barking and crying most of the day. I felt terrible but we couldn't take them and one customer was not happy. The Manager handled everything wonderful on both ends. We had a problem with the free internet hook up and the Manager came immediately to our room to help us. The breakfast was great for on the go people. The pool was clean and nice. The laundry facility was a hugh help in a pinch. The only thing I wished was to have a better frying pan in the room and a few more glasses in the room. We only had two. Even the other guests staying in the hotel were very friendly and not scary as my daughter says!",5,1
TownePlace Suites Cleveland Airport,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I am surprised that I haven't reviewed this place before, I am pretty good about reviewing my Marriotts, and this is one of my favorite places to stay when coming to Cleveland. I like this hotel, and usually stay here around the same time every year, and one perk I'll tell ya is that normally there are Browns players in the area since the Berea location is near and that is pretty cool. They have what you need, a nice big bed and mini kitchen area, and a feel litlle breakfast each morning. They have elevators, even if they only have three floors, which was great for me, on the second floor, with a baby. They have a computer in the main lobby, which my lil one and I watched video on youtube to help him go to sleep :) The only thing I am missing is a hot tub. Unless it is hidden really well from me.... but especially on longer stays, sometimes a hot tub hits the spot!! Thank you Marriott, you continue to help me justify why I am a long time Marriott girl. Til next year.",4,1
TownePlace Suites Cleveland Airport,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I was in an outpatient program at Cleveland Clinic and stayed here for 3 weeks. The Marriott Towne Place Suites was recommended to me by Cleveland Clinic, and many of my fellow program participants also stayed here. The rooms are sizable with free internet hook-up, very comfy queen-sized bed, sofabed, chair, and coffee table, a kitchenette with stove/oven, sink/disposal, dishwasher, and full refridgerator/freezer, and a large closet. A ""to-go"" breakfast is offered: muffins, granola bars, oatmeal, cereal, coffee, tea, juice, etc. There is shuttle service available to/from the Clinic, and the drivers are always extremely courteous and cautious while driving. In fact, the entire staff has given nothing less than outstanding service!! I was always warmly greeted when coming into the lobby, and every question was answered with a quick and friendly response. I would most definitely recommend the Marriott Towne Place Suites to anyone staying long-term in the Greater Cleveland Area.",5,1
TownePlace Suites by Marriott Cleveland Streetsboro,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I'm rating as 5 stars, because the staff here is very professional and very attentive. During the hotel's recent, annual smoke-alarm testing, the manager set me up in the neighboring Fairfield so that I'd have guaranteed quiet during a conference call. That was a creative solution which provided me with the necessary few quiet hours. I've stayed at several of Marriott's Renaissance and Autograph Collection hotels -- Marriott's upper tier -- but staff at this TPS bests them all. The hotel itself is showing some ageing issues, which I understand will be addressed in the new year. The beds are comfortable despite being a version behind the newer Marriott standard. The furniture in some rooms could be more comfortable; I recommend asking for a room with the newer style of couch rather than one with the sleeper-sofa style.",5,1

TownePlace Suites by Marriott Cleveland Streetsboro,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","We came here last month after a day of driving with a hot and road-weary cat. It was raining heavily and close to midnight, and most other motels in the area didn't take pets. There is a $25 pet fee at this Townplace Suites, but it was still a great place with friendly and helpful staff. The room was clean and had a kitchenette stocked with plates, pots/pans and flatware, along with a microwave, dishwasher and the usual coffeemaker, coffee and tea, etc. Breakfast was free and offered a lot more than expected, including yogurt, fruit, eggs and some impressive king-sized waffles. Definitely an option for travelers passing through this part of Ohio -- especially travelers with pets.",5,1
TownePlace Suites by Marriott Cleveland Streetsboro,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","It's an okay place, just like a Fairfield inn. The good thing is that the kitchen is nice you have a full stove and an oven and a dishwasher and a big fridge so if you're staying for extended period of time it would definitely work. The bed was a bit extra firm I would have preferred something a tad bit softer. The bathrooms are nice and clean and very much homelike. My couch was a bit worn out. They do have a nice workout place and a business center that are open 24 hours a day hence the three points overall.",3,0
TownePlace Suites by Marriott Cleveland Streetsboro,"Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel","I walked into this Townplace Suites off the Ohio Turnpike on a Saturday evening needing a night's stay with pets. The staff was friendly and helpful in providing delivery options for dinner. The bed and living area were comfortable. The kitchen and bathroom were not exactly modern in their decor, but both were clean and very functional. I don't usually bother with the free breakfast, but am glad I had another long day's drive ahead of me and decided I should have a hearty breakfast because breakfast on Sunday morning offered many options and was of a good quality. I will definitely consider the Townplace Suites brand more often in the future when traveling.",5,1

It was a bit tricky to find, nestled amid a bunch of newish-hotel complexes that all look the same in the dark. It was a standard traveling business suite. The room was nice and clean, kitchen looked good. We did make use of the fold out beds in both rooms and those mattresses were a little lumpy, but otherwise it was a good overnight place to stay right by the highway. The breakfast was pretty good compared to other freebies -- both hot and continental offerings. It was strange seeing pets in the hall and a cat in the window from the parking lot -- no allergies in the family so it was not an issue. The desk staff was very helping and friendly during the check-in and arranging for us to have adjoining rooms.",3,0

Twin Palms Rv Park,"Hotels & Travel, RV Parks, Campgrounds","So we chose this place after reading a review from another about how nice they are. This place is behind a motorcycle repair shop. Google mapping the area it seems iffy, but if you are looking for a place to stay in the RV for something such as spring training this place PERFECT. They are incredibly nice and accommodating. Of course like most of the area it isn't a kids run around type of place. We brought kids and it was fine because we didn't stay here for the amenities of the park. We slept and took the RV to the stadium and back. We will stay here next time and I highly recommend if you are looking for a place to stay to give it a shot.",5,1
Twin Palms Rv Park,"Hotels & Travel, RV Parks, Campgrounds","We recently stayed at Twin Palms for 2.5 months with our two dogs.

Twin Palms is located on a canal, which is great for walking dogs or riding bikes to the nearby grocery store. We met many delightful people during our stay here, our favorites being Paul and his lovely wife. They are genuinely just the nicest and most helpful people and we are so happy to have met them! If you are looking for a QUIET, CLEAN, SAFE park, this is the place for you!",5,1
Twin Palms Rv Park,"Hotels & Travel, RV Parks, Campgrounds","Stayed here at Steve's lot for 4 months.

Vegas Limo Coach,"Transportation, Hotels & Travel, Limos","Please skip past this company and hire one of the other hundreds of party bus companies in town. I am a Maid of Honor and needed a party bus for a bachelorette party. I was specifically looking for a two hour rental, that could be split into a one and a half hours of drive time, with a drop off at a show; and another half hour ride back from the show, to our hotel. I went through a large event company that could handle that kind of request. Through this event company I ordered an H2 party bus, for fifteen women, that we could bring our own alcohol in and had enough room to dance. This company subcontracted John with Vegas Limo Coach. There ended up being a mix up between John and the event company in regards to the time our party was scheduled to be picked up, it was a difference of fifteen minutes. John was very upset over the time change, and even though it was the businesses mistake, not mine, John made sure to let me have it. To make a very long story short, John was angry, rude and aggressive during our whole ride with him. John arrived to our destination not the H2 that we had paid for, that could accommodate our group, but a Mercedes limo coach, that is similar to a large van. He was upset that we were going to bring champagne onto his van, even though the event company confirmed with me it was okay to bring our own alcohol. I assured him we would take it with us when we left. Before we even entered the bus he started yelling at me about how angry he was with the event company, that he was ""in the business to make money,"" that he owned his business and how upset the time change had made him. When I explained to John that I did not understand how the time mix up could have happened, but I had already not only paid in full, but already added gratuity, it only made him yell loader. I then calmly explained that If he did indeed own the business, and he was in the business to make money, that I would appreciate it if he were more polite to me, as a paying customer. John then got within a foot away from me, raised his finger to my face and quietly said, ""you listen to me, I am twice your age, don't you even start with me."" I was upset and slightly frightened with his behavior, even frustrated it was not the party bus we had paid for, but I had no other option then to gather the girls onto the van anyways, or the entire night would have been ruined for the Bride. During the ride John stopped at the ""Welcome to Las Vegas"" sign as we had requested. But refused to get out and take our photos for us. When he dropped us off at our destination I asked for a moment of his time. I showed him my original reservation that confirmed the pick up time I originally planned, and that we should have been in an H2. John hit the piece of paper that was still in my hands with the back of his hand and yelled, ""well that's not me! I am sick of this company, I just got off the phone with that f**ker and I am never driving for that f**cking company again."" By this time I had had enough of the rudeness and disrespect. I informed John that I was appalled by the way he had treated me, and I would go out of my way to review him on every business review sight available, which undoubtedly would destroy his business. He got into his vehicle, with the window already rolled down, slammed the door, looked me right in the eyes and yelled, ""you are just a f**king wh@re to me."" I have never been so disrespected by a businessman in my life. That is when I finally (and honestly, to keep the integrity of this review) broke my calmness. I responded with, ""f**k you for talking to me like that."" he responded, ""Are you threatening me?"" (I can only assume he was referring to my promise to review his business). He yelled again, ""Are you f**cking threatening me? I am calling the police! I am parking my bus and calling Metro!"" I told him, ""Perfect, I will wait."" He then sped off, with no regards to the group of women standing near the front of the bus. And never returned. Obviously there was a communication error between the original event company and John's business. However, once I contacted the event company, after the altercation with John, they were not only embarrassed but incredibility apologetic. Even if the time mix up was the event companies' mistake, it wasn't mine, and John had absolutely no right to treat me, the customer, the way he did. As for my experience with John, I want to make a few facts clear. We were not a group of crazy 20-year-old women with condoms glued to veils and tutu's on. We are all well dressed, sophisticated, women in our thirties, all with incredibly professional careers within this valley. This kind of experience is impossible to make up, and I can only hope it defers you from hiring this horrible company.",1,0

Verve Car Rental,"Car Rental, Hotels & Travel","This company are unapologetic con artists, and was charged an extra day because I didn't read the fine print and specifically asked when to return my car, and on top of that, had to use Uber the remainder of my time in Vegas. On Expedia, this car rental is advertised with McCarren Airport Car rentals, which are open 24/7. Nowhere in the fine print does it state different hours. When you call ACE directly, they also state ACE is open 24/7, when I called to compain, they where surprised this location closed when it did. My fight left at 6am, so this car rental company opens at 6am, and they do not allow drop-offs while they are closed. I specifically asked when to return the car, and what time so I don't get charged the last day, I figured not paying the last day would offset the Uber charges. I returned at the time they told me, but later found they charged me another day because they claim I was 30 min late. I asked if they would work with me, and they said no, to read the fine print. I disputed the charge, but lost because the agreement was an agreement and I could not prove the times. No offer of a credit, nor an apology.",1,0

I said, NO. There was nothing in the fine print, but whatever. I told her I had the confirmation number and itinerary number, and the lady said she didn't see it. She didn't even bother to type in the itinerary number OR look it up. She asked for my ID, and still said she didn't see it.

Unprofessional young kids working here. They tried to give us a car with no plates then finally agreed to give us one with plates. Yes there was a sticker on the front windshield with registration but do we want to get pulled over in the first place and have to explain it to a cop? Not in Vegas on vacation! They didn't clean the car they just covered up the dirt smell with a very strong air freshener that made me sick every time I opened the car door!

I had to take a shuttle to the airport rental center and then jump on another Verve Shuttle to their rental site but the pickup was really quick and extremely courteous. Super nice shuttle driver!! It was worth the extra money saved in my opinion. Picking up my car was really fast too! Staff was helpful and friendly! Drop off was simple and only waited a few minutes to get me back to the rental car center drop off at the airport. I would rent from them again. Thanks Verve!!,5,1
Verve Car Rental,"Car Rental, Hotels & Travel","Do not rent from this place! The low price was the only good part of this experience. The frustration started with the over 30 minute wait for the shuttle. When we called the number as instructed in the confirmation e-mail, we got a recording. We called the other number provided, got a hold of a person, he promptly sent the call to the recording. Third try: talked to the person again...he simply said wait there, the shuttle was on the way. Please bear in mind the office is only 5 or so minutes away. On the way to the rental office the driver did a quick headcount explaining there may or may not be cars available for everyone despite the reservations everyone had. I felt lucky when I was assigned one until I got in to drive it...it was like sitting in an ashtray! I went back into the office and said something, two guys came out and poked their heads in the car and agreed that yes, it smells like smoke. Since there wasn't another available I was stuck with that though I was assured I would not be charged the $200 fee for smoking in the car. At no point was I offered any consolation for getting a car in that condition. When I returned the car I was assured the idiot that rented the car before me was charged the $200 cleaning fee for smoking in the car. Can I have that credited to my account since I had to put up with it?",1,0

Verve Car Rental,"Car Rental, Hotels & Travel","Was apprehensive in light to the reviews prior to patronizing Verve Car Rental. I also wondered how good the customer service could be, having paid at a rate much lower then any of the others online. After all, as the old adage says ""you get what you pay for."" Well, I got a great deal! They were very efficient, with wait time being shorter then I remember ever experiencing with other car rental agencies. The car was clean and topped up and ready to roll when I finished the paper work. I also was happy to note that they took photographs of the car to get a record of any extant flaws. That served to protect both me and them, so it was a win-win situation. A couple of days into my trip, I was having trouble starting the car. I called customer service and the agent told me exactly what I was doing wrong (it was a VW Jetta, which I was not familiar with). He told me to press down on the brake on the floorboard while turning the ignition key. After that, all was well. I was also unfamiliar with how to access the gas inlet, but I found out how to do that by googling it. Throughout my dealings with Verve, all, from customer service to the fellow who accepts the car upon return and the shuttle driver were very courteous. Oh, one last thing. I did get the size car I requested.",5,1
Verve Car Rental,"Car Rental, Hotels & Travel","I have never given a one-star rating before. I rented a car through Orbitz and my invoice was for $125 for unlimited miles through a company called Economy. The day I was to pick up my car we were confused at where their business was. We could not find ""Economy"" because the large front sign on the shopping center says ""VERVE"". I wasn't even sure I was at the right place at first ( my invoice did in fact mention Verve, it was in small print. I didn't see it but it was my mistake). However, ""Economy"" is on the glass window near entrance, it's small so if you're just driving by and there are cars parked in front of their store it might be hard to see the sign that says ""Economy"" but it's there. You have to walk up towards the store to see it. Once i went in and confirmed that I was at the right place, the gentleman who helped with my reservation first said: ""Well, since you're a local, you're paying for Limited Miles. I'm assuming you're renting a car to drive to California?"" (He was correct) ""you will need to pay extra for Unlimited Miles. That brings you from $125.47 to $208.94. For the unlimited miles."" I was baffled!! I told him my invoice showed I already paid for unlimited miles. He continued with ""Yeah. That's only if you're a tourist. Since your a local, your price is only for 125 miles. You're not getting to California on 125 miles. You'll need to pay for unlimited. I have rented cars before and never heard that before. I had a bad feeling about the pricing, but I still stuck with this place because I had to leave to California immediately. The gentleman then said ""I'll give you the best car I have right now. I'll save it for you."" He brought me to a 2014 black VW Jetta. This car had so many dents and scratches on it! Not only that, the car wasn't cleaned on the inside!! There were (food?) marks in the middle console, crumbs on the floor, and hand and feet prints on the dash board. This car was not cleaned. I am assuming the car was rented to me right after someone turned it in. If this was their ""best"" car at the time, I'd hate to see their ""worst"" car. I still took the car when I shouldn't have. I picked up my son and our luggage, and we headed to California. The engine was good. I'm glad we got one positive thing done. But about 40 minutes into our drive my son said ""MOM! I have ANTS in my leg!! The car had ANTS!! They were crawling from the bottom floor of the car on top of us!! I even stopped halfway through our trip to vaccume our car which unnecessarily delayed my trip. While driving in California we still had to battle these pesky ants occasionally. I was so glad to come back home to Las Vegas. I immediately dropped off our luggage then turned in the car. It cost me about $243 for the final invoice (way more than the initial $125 or the $208) but that's the price I had to pay to learn the lesson to never give this place a second chance.",1,0

Verve Car Rental,"Car Rental, Hotels & Travel","I really don't like to do this but this was by far the worse service that we have ever had! We arrived to the airport late because of a flight delay. We were waiting in the cold with our two yr old for 10mins before realizing in the distance that the shuttle was already there, when we walked to the shuttle the driver was deeply texting and stated to us that he thought we can see the ""Economy"" logo on the car from where we were standing! (It's really dark out). When arriving to to the car rental poor poor poor customer service! I proceeded to tell them how our experience was with the driver and they showed no interest, (not good) We had to get an upgrade because there were no more of what we reserved but the upgrade was just a trunk. We had no clue we were going to get a car without one initially. The car was not on a full tank of gas but could not get any service because everyone jetted out of there. When turning on AC the horrible smell of cigarettes killed our nostrils. The car was priced at $19 a day . We called the next morning to let them know the car was not filled in gas but still no help so we made the decision to take the car back. They charged us $97 for they total of 10hrs (bad) what happened to $19 a day??. We will never I mean never rent from them again!! I know it could be the group of employees at that office but the experience we had with them was so bad we felt like we were ripped off, deceived and No one cared not one bit!! What a way to start our stay here in Las Vegas.",1,0
Verve Car Rental,"Car Rental, Hotels & Travel","I initially gave Verve 2 stars when we picked up our car, because they were nice, and I understand the struggle of a startup. However, when we dropped the car off, the shuttle did not take us to the airport as the nice customer service girl told us....they took us to the the rental car center for the airport shuttles to take us to the airport. Verve felt like crooks, by deceiving people with the use of the Economy name. Terrible way to start out. Do better.",1,0

Verve Car Rental,"Car Rental, Hotels & Travel",Horrible. They are very deceptive. They say the are on site but are actually off site about 4 miles away from the airport. Once we arrived car was scratched up and personal were very rude. Went to leave and noticed no plates they informed me it was a temporary plate in the front window. I reluctantly drove off once arriving at the hotel I decided i wasn't comfortable driving a car with no permanent tag so I called them to pick it up. I waited over 1.5 hours downstairs to give them the key. They said there would be no charge but I have sice noticed a charge on my AMX for 35.88. Now I am in the process of getting my money back. Never again they would get 0 stars if I could.,1,0
Verve Car Rental,"Car Rental, Hotels & Travel","We booked a car with them through Priceline. On Priceline they went by the name Economy Rental Car so my husband and I were very confused when we arrived at the office. I read a lot of negative reviews saying that people didn't know they would have to take a shuttle from the airport and then an additional shuttle to their office, but Priceline made it very clear that it was a double shuttle, so that was not unexpected for me. However, when we arrived at the rent a car station we didn't realize we had to call to have the second shuttle come get us. When I first called it rang for 2-3 minutes until it went to voicemail. I left a message and continued to wait. We saw a van drive by with economy written on the side, but they didn't even pause! So we called the rental office back and someone answered and said they should be out there, but when I told her that we saw the driver go past she said ""oh, well it will be like 17 minutes before they're back."" It was pretty frustrating and overall took about 45 minutes from the time we got off the first shuttle and got to verve. The only reason I am giving them two stars instead of one is because during our drop off we had a chance to meet one of the owners and he actually was the shuttle driving back to the rent a car place. He was very nice and apologetic and seemed to really listen to our concerns.",2,0
Verve Car Rental,"Car Rental, Hotels & Travel","We had an overall good experience with Verve Car Rental. We found them because they're running a Groupon special for about $15 off your rental. We're just under 25, and they also charged the cheapest penalty (about $10/day) - we did try calling around to see if any company in Vegas would waive this fee, and they did not. Sabrina at the company was very helpful. We were in and out in about 20 mins after going over all the paperwork. We picked the most compact car for rental and paid around $220 after taxes and fees (plus under 25 penalty) for a Thursday through Tuesday rental and unlimited mileage within Nevada/the county. They had a 60 minute grace period on return, which was appreciated. The car itself was in OK condition - though there was a lingering smoke smell when we got in the car, which they had tried to cover up with air freshener. It was fairly clean, which is also how you are expected to return the vehicle or pay $200 cleaning (or pet/smoking violation) fee. Upon return, we had a quick, easy experience - again with Sabrina. She drove us back to the car rental center, where we caught a shuttle back to the airport. However, you do have to go pretty far off the strip to get to this place. Our cab driver wasn't quite sure where it was initially, despite living and driving in Vegas for years. There is a fairly cheap gas station and car wash in the same parking lot if you need to fill up or get the car cleaned upon return. I would rent here if you're under 25 and don't want to pay higher penalties elsewhere, want to get a good deal, and don't mind going the extra distance off the strip for a cheaper car. If you're looking for a flashy rental or 100% seamless experience, this is probably not the place. But if you can follow the contract, this place can be a lot better than most of the other reviews make it seem. Again, major props to Sabrina for great customer service - she deserves a raise!",4,1

Our tour guide didn't explain things clearly....was always running off to the ticket booth, etc leaving the group esp for those who get off the bus last (sitting in the last few rows) confused and lost. The time/schedule restriction was way too strict - being late 10-15 mins happens and is expected when traveling w/ the elderly and one being sick, one shouldn't be put on blast, harassed and embarrassed in front of the entire group. Knowing that we were slightly late and in the wrong, I apologized on several occasions- during the phone call, then the txt msg right after the call, then his scowl when we met up and then once again on the bus - forcing me to sing in front of the group as a form of punishment. I felt it was a little bit excessive for a paying customer.....and didn't think I should be treated that way....again, me traveling w/ the elderly and me fighting a terrible cold/flu in which I clearly explained to our guide during the tongue lashing.

Wonder Travel,"Travel Services, Hotels & Travel, Tours","Wonder travel is the most unprofessional and disrespectful company I have ever seen. We booked the independent tour for 3 days in NYC. On our first day, it took us 8 hours to get to New York which isn't quite normal. We left Montreal at 4:15 am on stanley street. There was already a transmission problem on the first day and they tried to hide it from everyone else by taking more breaks. Why would they even take a bus that hasn't even been through inspection. On the second day, this is the worst experience of my life. We were stranded on the highway starting from 6:40 pm until 10:15pm. There was one bottle of water offered to each person but there was no food. The bathroom was polluting the air in the bus. There were kids and elderly and the guide Richard kept on telling us to stay on the bus. The guide never called the police. According to the law of the highway, it is dangerous and prohibited to have a stopped vehicle. He either told us absolutely nothing or he would try to convince us that the other bus was coming to pick us up. Thankfully my friends and I decided to take our own money to call a Lyft (app similar to Uber). The rest of the passengers who were from other countries stayed in the bus until 12 am. Their way to find solutions are absolutely unprofessional. Richard also promised the other passengers that they would be able to order pizza once they arrive to the hotel at midnight. That was not the case. The rest of them never got the chance to eat when they arrived because everything was closed, even McDonald's (took 30 minutes to arrive to hotel). The next day, we were told to leave at 8:30 am. The bus never even came around that time. The bus only came at 10:30 am. I called the Agency telling them that they are not professional and incapable to handle stressful situations. They kept on lying to their passengers and this was bullshit. The lady called Nancy then told me that I was being disrespectful. I'm sorry but this is not being disrespectful, this is reality. She didn't understand how bad the situation was and would not even try to see what kind of problems we encountered. Wonder travels is the worst company to travel with. My friend called when we got back to montreal asking for a compensation because of all the time that we wasted. The supervisor Ashley said she couldn't do anything but to take off 30$ on our next trip. The passengers from our trip told us that this wasn't the first time it happened. In addition, we were suppose to get dropped off to Times Square for the second day but the guide kept on giving us excuses on how it wasn't possible for the driver to stop the bus to let us off. I took initiative and asked the driver myself in french, he was kind and said : Of course I don't mind, why didn't you tell me earlier, I would of dropped you guys near Times Square instead of on our way to the statue of liberty. Please avoid travelling with this company. If you are on a budget, go with Concord Tours or pay a little bit more to go with Sinorama.",1,0

We were told on wednesday night that there were 23 seats available and we were 3 people, so one of us booked and 2 were a bit busy, we tried to book the next day but magically all of the seats were gone. That was for saturday actually. We asked them on friday morning to transfer our friend's seat to Sunday (at that time there were 14 seats available) and no matter how much we bargained they wouldnt change a thing. 2. They seem to be very strict about time, which I do understand. However on the bus they say it very clearly that we will leave without you if you're late. I thought they should maybe make the effort to call people that are late..maybe they do 3. The tour guide, despite speaking 3 languages, has a very veryyyy pronounced chinese accent which makes him annoyiinngg to listen to. At rare times i couldnt understand him, but in general I did.",3,0

Zipcar,"Car Rental, Truck Rental, Hotels & Travel, Automotive, Car Share Services","3 stars, with an itch to give a 4th because it's just so cool. but, there are some issues that should be addressed. I had similar frustrations as Alyson Y. signing up. In the online application, I was given the option to have my card mailed to my home address, or I could pick it up at my local office in D.C. lol. I have no idea where they came up with D.C. being my local office when I live in North Oakland here in Pitt. So, I had it sent to my home address. The emails were confusing, i got one on Friday that said it should be at my house that day. By Tuesday, nothing, so I emailed them. They said it hadn't really been mailed out until Monday (3 days/1 business day after the email said). By Thursday, I still hadn't gotten anything. So, I filled out the online form that most closely matched my situation: requesting a new card. I got an auto-reply saying they would mail it out and charge me a replacement fee. A bit frustrated, I called the support phone number. It's true they don't make it easy to get through without a card id number, but I just kept trying 0 and # until I got a person. I got a guy on the phone, he was very helpful. He didn't understand why they had D.C. as my local office either, but he canceled the replacement card and instructed me that I could walk down to the office (about 1/3 mile from where I work) and get a card there that day. Which I did, and it was smooth sailing after that (so far, knock wood). Just for fun, I took out a car twice that night. They were a bit dirty, but it's been a nasty couple of wintery weeks here so it's understandable. The car's are kinda stripped down, I was surprised neither the Audi nor the Hybrid had automatic lights. But the whole experience is just geeky and fun. I work downtown, and live in Oakland; so for me the zipcar locations couldn't be more ideal unless they put one in my driveway. I think the main thing that makes it such a great value for me is the deal I got through my employer. No application fee, no monthly fee, just the low annual fee. I think I will still be using my old rental car company for longer trips, but with with gas and insurance included? I dunno, it might be cheaper to stick with Zip exclusively. I am going back to Cincinnati this weekend and was happy to see there are Zips there as well. (how did i miss that when i lived there?). So, instead of renting like I usually do, i think it will be greyhound and cincinnati's zipcars for me this time (they are a couple dollars cheaper there too:) That brings up my only real complaint. When I first heard of this concept, I thought the strength would lie in the ability to just pick up a car, go where you want, and drop it off for the next guy. I.e. one-way, short term rentals. Seems so much more green. Since Zipcar requires you to leave the car where you pick it up, that greatly limits the usability of this whole concept. Competitive one way option, Zipcar, and you will corner this market.",3,0

Zipcar,"Car Rental, Truck Rental, Hotels & Travel, Automotive, Car Share Services","In a city that's so dependent on the car, I love that Zipcar even has a presence in Pittsburgh at all. True, the cars seem to be disproportionately located downtown, but I've found the locations to be quite convenient and accessible. In fact, Zipcar has enabled me to forgo renting a car during my stay here, and instead use their service for the occasional long-haul errand. I have my eye on a Mini Cooper that I'm just waiting for an excuse to drive...",5,1
Zipcar,"Car Rental, Truck Rental, Hotels & Travel, Automotive, Car Share Services","I was a pretty big fan of Zipcar a few years ago. It worked well for my needs. To save money, I cancelled my membership for a while. Later, I paid the $75 signup fee and re-registered. To actually use my account, I needed a new card. And it's been a big pain since then. Every time I logged into my account online, Zipcar would pop up with a big message: ""Your Zipcard is in the mail!"" So I waited. And waited some more. After a couple weeks, I tried emailing Zipcar. No response. Then I tried calling the Pittsburgh office. They told me they'd send out a new card right away. Never received it. I tried calling the main Zipcar number, but it prompted me for my card number and gave no other options, so I couldn't speak with anybody. Then I tried to call the Pittsburgh office a few more times. I always got a machine, left a message, and never got a call back. Tried to email Zipcar again, got no response. I called the Zipcar 800 number again, got around the robot by making up a Zipcard number, and spoke with a person who sent me a new card. I kinda kicked myself for not outwitting the phone robot earlier, but so it goes. I made a reservation and walked a half mile to the Zipcar nearest to my house. My Zipcard wouldn't unlock the car. Called Zipcar, which unlocked the car for me and told me to dig around in the trunk for a spare Zipcard reserved for occasions such as this. No Zipcard in the trunk, so I wouldn't be able to use the car I'd reserved. The rep offered to reserve another car, at a more expensive hourly rate, two miles from where I was standing. I declined. Now I'm waiting on another card in the mail. If the new card doesn't work (assuming I actually receive it), I'm cancelling my membership. Port Authority can be a pain, but at least I know it'll take me where I need to go. Maybe I've just experienced an insane string of bad luck with Zipcar, but I'd say that if you really need reliable transportation and you either haven't received your card, or you have yet to use a new card, don't depend on Zipcar. If you've passed the card hurdles, Zipcar may work out for you.",2,0
Zipcar,"Car Rental, Truck Rental, Hotels & Travel, Automotive, Car Share Services","Zipcar is horrible. I rented a car, and returned the car in good time (10 minutes earlier than the due time). However, zipcar insisted that I returned 9 minutes late, and charged me 55 dollars of late fee. ($50 dollars late fee + half an hour extra usage fee). I called them, the customer representative insisted that i was late, and only waived me 27 dollars. I have no idea what happened to the rest of the money. But I did return on time. I made sure to look at the time after I parked it and swiped my zipcard! Plus, nowadays, everyone uses cellphone whose time is sync'ed to the wireless carrier. So undoubtedly, I had the correct time. I am going to cancel my zipcar membership.",1,0

There was no wait and our room was ready. The room was large and spotless. It was also beautiful. I did not want to go home. We were there on a business trip with others, so we enjoyed the conference rooms, the buffet service while in conference and the excellent service. The hotel has all the amenities you want and need. It is a Ritz and you know it the minute you walk in the door. And they will help you with a little French if you ask. It was a wonderful time and I can't wait to go back.",5,1
the Ritz-Carlton Montreal,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","For my 300th review on Yelp....I decided to write about celebrating my Mami's Birthday at the Ritz-Carlton where we went for Afternoon High Tea! I had emailed the hotel a few days before requesting a reservation and stated that it was to celebrate my Mother's Birthday! I received prompt responses via email to my inquiries and the booking of my reservation via email. On the morning of our reservation, I received a telephone call to confirm our reservation which was thoughtful and professional. Afternoon Tea is served from 12:30-3 (or 3:30)...we opted for 12:30 and were second in-line upon arrival at the hotel and therefore able to choose our seating arrangement. There is a beautiful fireplace and the decor was absolutely stunning not mention classy. As it was my Mami's birthday I was told that they could either put a house-made chocolate sign that stated ""Happy Birthday"" on the tea sandwich tower or purchase a chocolate cake for $36.00 Canadian. I opted for the Chocolate ""Happy Birthday"" sign as we were traveling and could not consume that much cake ;)! We opted for a glass of French Champagne prior to the tea as a celebratory toast to my Mother's Birthday which was nice...there were several varieties of Champagne to choose from and I chose the Veuve-Cliquot which was perfect for us. We worked our way from the top of the tea tower to the bottom: First the scones with two types of jam and clotted cream; Second the tea sandwiches of cucumber, tuna, egg salad, and salmon; Third the desserts...by this time I could only eat one...so I opted for the Napoleon...which was divine! Oh-and we did have a Moroccan peppermint tea which was soothing and complimentary to the sweets and sandwiches without being overpowering. (There were several pages on the menu of tea choices!) The waitstaff was exceptionally attentive and the ambiance was warm and delightful and almost all of the seating choices were occupied for Afternoon Tea. (So make a reservation in advance if you decide to go). This was a most memorable birthday for my Mother who continues to talk about how much the whole experience meant to her-as the last time we had ""Tea at the Ritz"" was in London when I was thirteen with a great aunt who lived there.",5,1

We had a city view and there a nice nook on the other side of the tub that you can just sit in to view the city. The location is nice. High end area with lots of shopping. Easy to get taxis or Ubers from. We didn't dine at the hotel. My girlfriend enjoyed the spa. I thought the gym was pretty good, they have a spin bike. The rooftop pool was nice to hang out at when the weather was bad one of the days of our trip. We had a great stay at the Ritz and would recommend it for a luxury hotel experience.",5,1
the Ritz-Carlton Montreal,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","I brought my mum here for her 70th birthday a couple of years ago, as I had promised her an afternoon tea at the ritz for her birthday, unfortunately that was before we moved to Montreal from London, UK, but I thought it would be nice anyway, unfortunately, the order was wrong, I hate earl grey tea, but no complaints, it was my mum's special day, but really the cakes and sandwiches were really sub par as my step dad is dairy intolerant and he was given buttered sandwiches, really poor, in my opinion",3,0

the Ritz-Carlton Montreal,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Oh the Ritz darling, what a fabulous experience!! Located in downtown Montreal in a bustling area, parking is a real devil, but no worries my travel friends. This world class hotel has active valet attendants, and gentlemen at that. When I pulled up I was a few minutes late for my high tea 5:30 reservation. Inquiring to the salons location, the valet offered his arm and chaperoned me through their beautiful revolving front entrance, down a busy hall off to the right, perfectly square in front of the tea room, their Palm Lounge. Now that my lovelies is class. I thanked him kindly and tipped him graciously on my exit for his generous time and effort. Once inside this newly remodeled building, one cannot help to feel so enchanted by the exquisite decor and sophisticated guests. It makes you stand a little taller with your shoulders back, no slouching here baby cakes. Upon checking in, the maitre d was not able to verify my reservation, but he double checked a more recent list and sat me at a smart yet comfortable two chair and glass table set up. With my big fur coat in hand, it was nice to plunk it down and let my arm rest for a while in the extra chair. That sucker is a hefty 10lb ensemble, but no complaints doll. None. The Palm Lounge is a long and narrow two sided court area with several brass covered fireplaces dotting the space. After an hour, the soft palette lighting was exchanged for fun and fanciful pink, purple, and blue changing lights. It made for a fantasy aurora and something unique, while still be classy all the same. A smart tea menu was presented with several portion sizes of goodies, along with multiple types of tea, as well as Champagnes to indulge in. Wanting to splurge a smidge, I ordered the full serving of tea snacks with an herbal tisane tea. With a wonderful refreshing glass of Dom Perignon 2006 Rose. Now, I wouldn't usually go all out like that, but we really only life once. And at $100 Canadian, which is equivalent to $80 US currency for that one glass of bubbly, it was worth every pink semi dry drop. Oh yes honey!! The finger sandwiches and scones were filling without overwhelming. The tea was fragrant and robust, but not lacking in complexity in spite of there being no caffeine. Truly, the only missing ingredient was the service. Staff did not pour my tea, which in other locations is the proper protocol. And they didn't ask if I would like my bubbly during or after my tea. Actually I wanted to enjoy both at the same time. To his horror, the manager rolled his eyes at my request and probably mumbled to himself how us silly American could be so uncouth. Well pardon me monsieur. It is how I prefer to enjoy it, and not you or your customs that dictate my preference. Overall, I stayed my 2 hours and was happy to go on my way. Little did I know, that even though I just spent $180 Canadian/ $150 US on a very skimpy, but enjoyable meal, was the valet service not included. Another $15 and out I go. Now I know the Ritz is expensive, but doll really, they should pro-rate their services based on money spent. Perhaps I should of asked a manager for clarification or assistance. Or just walked there from my hotel, which was literally 5 doors down. Oh well, that's life. Enjoy and don't fret over the small potatoes.",4,1
the Ritz-Carlton Montreal,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","*This review is for my High Tea experience only* Let me start by saying that like any Ritz Carlton Hotel, it is GORGEOUS. The lobby is beautiful, we had tea in the Palm Room which is right past the lobby. I did a lot of digging as far as finding a great place to have my afternoon tea. So I had some pretty high expectations going in. We called to make reservations ahead of time, which I highly recommend you do so you have your spot reserved, they do not serve tea all day. Once we arrived there was an attendant waiting to show us to our table. The Palm Room is gorgeous, it was calm and relaxing, I'm sure the music contributed to that. Pastry Chefs Creations: Sandwiches are made fresh in house. My favorites were the cucumber and mint, and the chicken and pesto. But my husband loved the salmon too. We selected the tea package that came with a glass of champagne, for not that much $ extra. Our waiter was able to make recommendations based on my preferences for tea. I don't recall the tea selection being anything extraordinary and I would not say it was ""the best tea I ever had"" but the Devonshire style cream and fresh jam served with the scones are to die for! We paired this all with a glass of Moët & Chandon Impérial Rosé, because what is afternoon tea without some bubbly?! Service: Honestly, I will not give this experience a 5 because it is THE RITZ CARLTON, they pride themselves on their excellent customer service, and I did not experience anything above the ordinary. And I wished our waiter had come around to our table more often to check on us. Of course, this is just my personal experience, and we were only there for High Tea, so your experience may be different. This is an excellent place if you're looking for a relaxing Afternoon Tea put together by experienced chefs.",4,1

the Ritz-Carlton Montreal,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","This was the most amazing hotel experience I've ever had. The lobby is just gorgeous. So traditional, romantic, just beautiful. Brought us bottles of water right when we walked in. Like they could read my mind! While checking in they asked if we needed anything else and I asked for almond milk with my coffee in the morning, which they said they'd get for me. Score! The room was just as amazing. Huge closet. Double shades on the windows. Bathroom: omg, the bathroom. The toilet was one of those Japanese toilets with a warmed seat, bidet that comes out and sprays your nether regions and then dries. The bathtub was screaming to be used, so I did. I could almost swim in it. It was huge! I filled it all the way up and never ran out of hot water. Just amazing. We went to the restaurant downstairs one night for dinner, which was amazing, but that's another review (Maison Boulud). The 2nd night we got room service brought up. Everything was pretty small servings, but that was kinda expected. But the set up was beautiful. It's possible I may not ever stay in another hotel while in Montreal ever again.

the Ritz-Carlton Montreal,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Hey, it's the Ritz, what can I say? This hotel is five stars all the way with the only sad exception of not having a spa. Not that I have all the money in the world to spend on spa services but there's something comforting about knowing that the option is available should I wake up one morning and decide I'm deserving of a signature spa treatment, agreed? Well work brought me to this hotel (as it so often does) and it was a great experience from the moment I arrived. We held several meetings and lunches in their ballroom spaces and the entire staff made sure our events were a success. The spaces themselves are very nice and I love the furniture and decor of the rooms. Let's talk about their room service menu. Order the pancakes (crepes) for breakfast. Wanna know why? That. Maple. Syrup. WOW! I don't know about you but syrup can really make or break a pancake and the syrup they use elevates the pancakes to another level. In addition to the syrup, they dress the pancakes with fresh berries. Listen, I've never met a berry I didn't like and something about the berries in Canada makes me want to do a little dance. All the fruits are the right size and flavorful, not like the shit we find in the US that's packed with who knows what and can range from the size of my hand to my head. These are LEGIT berries so I recommend you get down with them. Bathroom products...what they placed in my room (purple labeling) I was not about because it was way too fragrant but no need to fret, they are prepared to offer you other brands that may be more to your liking. I opted for Kiehl's products and I was satisfied. TOTO Neorest toilets. Enough said. All Ritz properties boast the best beds ever. #nolie Freeeeeeeeeee wifi! If you make it to the restaurant attached to the hotel (Maison Boulud), order the first word cocktail and top off your night with the chocolate coulant for dessert. Merci, Ritz Montreal.",5,1

the Ritz-Carlton Montreal,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services",The Ritz on Sherbrooke really does not look like much but once you pass the doormen into the lobby the hotel transforms into a oasis of glamor in the city. The front desk representatives were friendly and helpful. Basically check in was a breeze. I have been in the Ritz before but this was my first time staying there so my expectations were high. My room was appointed tastefully and felt like I was the first one to use it. Clean and not a wrinkle or piece out of place. The king size bed was tall and very comfortable but a little too soft for my taste. One thing I noticed right away was how quite the room was. With all the traffic outside and just the city noise the room was very quiet. If you call to reserve a room make sure to ask for a upper level room when facing the Sherbrook Mount Royal side. Room on that side are not as sunny in the morning but have a nice afternoon sun. Tip: When heading out make sure to call at least ten minutes prior to have your car valet to the front. Saturday afternoon before the dinner hour it can get busy with hotel guests all trying to get their cars to venture out into the city.,4,1
the Ritz-Carlton Montreal,"Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services","Always wanted to try out a proper British high tea service and hands down, the Ritz Carlton hotel is the place to experience it. The hotel itself has a storied past, with the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton getting married here for their second time around, visiting dignitaries always ended up staying here as well as more than the odd movie star or rock star. These days unfortunately, it's full of the nouveau-riche. Lots of big hair, status purses, giant fur coats and too much perfume. Nonetheless, with gilded walls, golden mirrors, understated but elegant decor and extremely comfortable chairs, it's easy to tune out that Miami-beach, Beverly Hills wannabe crowd. If you have always wanted to try out a high tea service, with scones, clotted cream, cucumber sandwiches and dainty pastries, look no further. Service was extremely attentive, our tea pots were constantly being refilled, the servers were excellent in explaining all the pastries and sandwiches and were not too obtrusive. The one thing which stops me from giving the experience a full five stars is that for all the hype, the sandwich bread did dry out quickly and I found it strange that the maitre d' stopped by our table to give us a cross-examination when I did not see him do that to anyone else. This is definitely a wonderful place to hang-out and decompress with a friend or two for a casual and leisurely Sunday afternoon or after a hectic afternoon of shopping.",4,1
